Hi, honey, how was school today?   <br>
 <br>
Well, the metal detectors<br>
were down, so the popular kids   <br>
 <br>
were all on edge all day,<br>
so that was kind of fun.   <br>
 <br>
Oh, and we also got our yearbooks.   <br>
 <br>
Ooh, let me see.   <br>
 <br>
I love seeing what my handsome<br>
boy's been up to all year.   <br>
 <br>
Oh, there's the student council,<br>
and the cheerleaders.   <br>
 <br>
Peter, w-why is there<br>
a photo of you in here?   <br>
 <br>
I'm in the Peter club.   <br>
 <br>
It's just me and this guy Jason<br>
who joined as a joke.   <br>
 <br>
Jason's, like, hilarious.   <br>
 <br>
Wait a minute. Chris,<br>
there's no pictures of you.   <br>
 <br>
Huh, I guess not.   <br>
 <br>
Chris, honey, I keep telling you,   <br>
 <br>
you need to get involved<br>
in extracurricular activities.   <br>
 <br>
Otherwise you won't get into college,   <br>
 <br>
and you'll end up a garbageman   <br>
 <br>
or a congresswoman from Colorado.   <br>
 <br>
Okay, okay, fine.<br>
I'll look for a club tomorrow.   <br>
 <br>
Your mom's right, Chris.<br>
You got to get into college.   <br>
 <br>
Mostly so you can constantly   <br>
 <br>
jam into conversation where you went.   <br>
 <br>
Have you been to that new<br>
restaurant, Kristof's, downtown?   <br>
 <br>
- It's amazing.<br>
- No, but that reminds me   <br>
 <br>
of when I was at school in Cambridge.   <br>
 <br>
Oh, you went to Harvard?   <br>
 <br>
No, the Cambridge Technical<br>
College for Dullards and Mutes.   <br>
 <br>
Not to brag, but there are<br>
commercials for it on TV.   <br>
 <br>
Because it's embarrassing<br>
to see you in jeans at church.   <br>
 <br>
That's why.   <br>
 <br>
Yeah, I'm sure it was fine<br>
back home in Tampa.   <br>
 <br>
Now hold still.   <br>
 <br>
Hey, Brian, could you drive me<br>
to Joann Fabrics?   <br>
 <br>
I'm gonna put in some elastic<br>
'cause I've learned my lesson.   <br>
 <br>
Sure, just got to stop at the bank.   <br>
 <br>
Still getting my accounts sorted out   <br>
 <br>
after that Russian hacker thing.   <br>
 <br>
Ah, yes, that Ivan fellow.   <br>
 <br>
I can't believe Meg<br>
stayed behind to be with him.   <br>
 <br>
Well, they seemed pretty happy together.   <br>
 <br>
Still, it's got to be hard<br>
leaving your whole life behind   <br>
 <br>
and adapting to a foreign culture.   <br>

Absolutely, Chris.   <br>

Oh, really? And why is that?    <br>

'Cause I know you've been<br>
making p*rn in the school.    <br>
 <br>
I... You can't prove that.    <br>

I heard your voice on one of the videos.    <br>

(SIGHS) All right, you caught me.    <br>

You see, Chris, we educators<br>
don't make a lot of money.    <br>

plus all the school A/V equipment,    <br>

I realized I was only<br>
a box of wet naps away    <br>

supposed to throw those away.    <br>

I'm not making any money.    <br>

Wow, that's a pretty sad story,<br>

But you want to know<br>
the saddest part of all?    <br>

Your p*rn sucks, bro.    <br>
 <br>
What? What are you talking about?    <br>
 <br>
Well, let's start with the titles.    <br>
 <br>
Who calls their p*rn "Man<br>
and Woman Having Standard Sex"?    <br>
 <br>
You got to work the algorithm, man.    <br>
 <br>
You need keywords like "stepsister,"    <br>
 <br>
"stepbrother," "stepmom."    <br>
 <br>
Just put "step" and a noun<br>
and it should work.    <br>
 <br>
Even "stepladder"<br>
is getting traction these days.    <br>
 <br>
You know, if you want<br>
to make this thing work    <br>
 <br>
and start making money,<br>
I can help you out.    <br>
 <br>
You want to help me?    <br>
 <br>
Actually, I think<br>
we can help each other.    <br>
 <br>
You need help with this thing,    <br>
 <br>
I need an after-school activity<br>
so my mom gets off my back,    <br>

 <br>
and I'll show you where<br>
the eye-wash stations are.    <br>
 <br>
- Mrs. Griffin?<br>
- Principal Shepherd,    <br>
 <br>
are you in on this, too?    <br>
 <br>
Certainly not. I have no idea<br>
what's going on here.    <br>
 <br>
Principal Shepherd,<br>
Starla is officially a no-show,    <br>
 <br>
so the nine-some is now an eight-some.    <br>
 <br>
All right, put her per diem<br>
back in petty cash,    <br>
 <br>
tell Sue Ann in makeup<br>
it's her lucky day,    <br>
 <br>
tell lighting it's legs up in five,    <br>
 <br>
and let's sh**t this thing.    <br>
 <br>
I mean, what?    <br>
 <br>
We begin with a reading<br>
from the Russian Orthodox Bible.    <br>
 <br>
And Jesus said to Mikhail,    <br>
 <br>
"The radio you sold me last week<br>
does not work."    <br>
 <br>
Mikhail said to Him, "How do I know    <br>
 <br>
you didn't break it on purpose<br>
to get your money back?"    <br>
 <br>
Then they got in a fistfight on the bus.    <br>
 <br>
- Amen.<br>
- BOTH: Amen.    <br>
 <br>
I now pronounce Ukraine<br>
actually part of Russia,    <br>
 <br>
and I also pronounce you<br>
husband and wife.    <br>
 <br>
You may share a joyless kiss.    <br>
 <br>
(AUDIENCE SHOUTING)    <br>
 <br>
This is an outrage.    <br>
 <br>
p*rn doesn't belong in school,<br>
it belongs on public trains.    <br>
 <br>
I guess if I don't bring<br>
brownies, nobody does.    <br>
 <br>
Please, everyone, not all at once.    <br>
 <br>
Is there an Alpha Karen<br>
who can speak for all of you?    <br>
 <br>
First of all, I want you to know<br>
I'm filming this.    <br>
 <br>
Second of all, I'm gonna<br>
get really angry really fast    <br>
 <br>
for no reason.    <br>
 <br>
Listen, folks, I-I can explain.    <br>
 <br>
What is there to explain?    <br>
 <br>
That you've been using<br>
our children's school    <br>
 <br>
to make p*rn?    <br>
 <br>
That-that you took advantage of my son?    <br>
 <br>
(OVERLAPPING CHATTER)    <br>
 <br>
This is getting away from me.    <br>
 <br>
Maybe I can filibuster this    <br>
 <br>
by reading the owner's manual<br>
for my Toyota Cressida.    <br>
 <br>
"Dear consumer,<br>
making cars is really hard.    <br>
 <br>
There are so many parts, you guys."    <br>
 <br>
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)    <br>
 <br>
Wait. Everybody, wait a minute.    <br>
 <br>
That's the boy who was<br>
talking to an owl outside.    <br>
 <br>
Let him speak.    <br>
 <br>
Look, Principal Shepherd may<br>
have made some bad decisions,    <br>
 <br>
but he didn't do it for himself.    <br>
 <br>
It was all to raise money<br>
for the school.    <br>
 <br>
Oh, is-is that true, Principal Shepherd?    <br>
 <br>
Um...    <br>
 <br>
- Well, I-I...<br>
- Of course it's true.    <br>
 <br>
Every year they slash the school budget,    <br>
 <br>
and this man did what he had to do    <br>
 <br>
to give us the education we deserve.    <br>
 <br>
You know the reading specialist we have?    <br>
 <br>
Paid for by a "Das Boot."    <br>
 <br>
What's a "Das Boot"?    <br>
 <br>
That's when a whole bunch of German men    <br>
 <br>
go down at the same time.    <br>
 <br>
He's right, everyone.    <br>
 <br>
With all those budget cuts,<br>
I had no choice.    <br>
 <br>
It was either make p*rn,<br>
or pass a modest tax increase    <br>
 <br>
on the wealthiest citizens of Quahog.    <br>
 <br>
A tax hike that'll affect none of us?    <br>
 <br>
That's the last thing we want.    <br>
 <br>

 <br>
Chris, that was some<br>
quick thinking back there.    <br>
 <br>
You saved my career. Thank you.    <br>
 <br>
Hold it right there, Principal Shepherd.    <br>
 <br>
Now, I appreciate that you were<br>
trying to help out the school,    <br>
 <br>
but how could you get my son<br>
involved in something like this?    <br>
 <br>
- You've corrupted him.<br>
- "Corrupted"?    <br>
 <br>
This was the best thing<br>
that ever happened to me.    <br>
 <br>
See, before we started making p*rn,    <br>
 <br>
I didn't care about anything    <br>
 <br>
because I wasn't good at anything.    <br>
 <br>
But now, I'm using skills<br>
I never knew I had.    <br>
 <br>
I'm writing scripts, making<br>
schedules and balancing budgets.    <br>
 <br>
And it's all thanks<br>
to Principal Shepherd.    <br>

Why don't we visit family in America?    <br>
