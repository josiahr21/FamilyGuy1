emasculate me.    <br>

Ah! Ah! (GRUNTS)    <br>

Stop! Wait! I want<br>
Mrs. Padberry-Wilkerson back!    <br>

Mrs. Padberry-Wilkerson is in the loo.    <br>
 <br>
Ah! Bring back that Southern guy.    <br>

Sorry, I'm busy watching    <br>

(AS GILBERT GOTTFRIED):<br>
I'm Gilbert Gottfried,    <br>
 <br>
and I was fired by Aflac for no reason.    <br>
 <br>
Well, there-there was some reason.    <br>
 <br>
I can't believe Peter's lost his voice.    <br>
 <br>
How's he gonna insult Meg now?    <br>
 <br>
Well, I don't know if it's gonna work,    <br>
 <br>
but he brought a whiteboard.    <br>
 <br>
Meg's got the ball.    <br>
 <br>
Peter, quick, write something mean.    <br>
 <br>
"You're doing to this game<br>
what R. Kelly did to all tho..."    <br>
 <br>
Yeah, no, no, I'm not saying<br>
the rest of that.    <br>
 <br>
- (WHISTLE BLOWS)<br>
- (SIGHS) Peter, you're too slow.    <br>
 <br>
Let me try to give her the business.    <br>
 <br>
Uh, Meg, honey,<br>
you used to walk pigeon-toed    <br>
 <br>
but got better with the right shoes!    <br>
 <br>
(BUZZER SOUNDS)    <br>
 <br>
(CROWD JEERS)    <br>
 <br>
Well, that'll do it    <br>
 <br>
from the Adam West High Gymnasium,    <br>
 <br>
where the home team goes down<br>
in a nine-seven slugfest.    <br>
 <br>
We're so sorry, honey.    <br>
 <br>
Yeah, but it turns out    <br>
 <br>
our team is still advancing<br>
to the championship game.    <br>
 <br>
- Really?<br>
- Yeah.    <br>
 <br>
The other team was disqualified<br>
from the league.    <br>
 <br>
I guess one of them<br>
was Gilbert Gottfried.    <br>
 <br>
I have to do something.    <br>
 <br>
Y'all mind if I record this    <br>
 <br>
for teaching purposes or whatever?    <br>
 <br>
Sure.    <br>
 <br>
Now, Mrs. Padberry-Wilkerson,    <br>
 <br>
can you tell me about<br>
Stewie's "problem"?    <br>
 <br>
(HIGH-PITCHED): Well,<br>
it's not something a proper lady    <br>
 <br>
is used to talking about,    <br>
 <br>
but I believe it was something he saw.    <br>
 <br>
(SOUTHERN ACCENT): What's<br>
the big deal? It's just sex.    <br>
 <br>
Mrs. Padberry-Winkie-Woo is just a prude    <br>
 <br>
who's never gotten enough "vitamin D,"    <br>
 <br>
if you know what I mean.    <br>
 <br>
(HIGH-PITCHED): Excuse me.    <br>
 <br>
I will have you know<br>
I am a tigress in the bedroom.    <br>
 <br>
- This is ridiculous.<br>
- Shh.    <br>
 <br>
I find the best thing to do<br>
with multiple personalities    <br>
 <br>
is to summon them all    <br>
 <br>
and let them work out they differences.    <br>
 <br>
(SOUTHERN ACCENT):<br>
Oh, is that so, Miss Tigress?    <br>
 <br>
(HIGH-PITCHED): Quite right.    <br>
 <br>
(SOUTHERN ACCENT): How's<br>
about you hoist off them BVDs,    <br>
 <br>
and I do you on a front yard couch?    <br>
 <br>
(HIGH-PITCHED): Why, Mr. Boone,<br>
you're terrible. Don't stop.    <br>
 <br>
(SOUTHERN ACCENT): I ain't gonna.    <br>
 <br>
- (MOANING)<br>
- Enough. Stewie.    <br>
 <br>
You're losing it because<br>
you haven't napped in days.    <br>
 <br>
You're cranky. You're scared.    <br>
 <br>
Listen, what you saw<br>
in Peter and Lois's bedroom    <br>
 <br>
is not what you think.    <br>
 <br>
It was just... Lois looking<br>
very closely at the sheets    <br>
 <br>
so she could check the thread count.    <br>
 <br>
And Peter was just...<br>
cheering her on from behind.    <br>
 <br>
Really? That makes sense.    <br>
 <br>
I like that. Phew.    <br>
 <br>
Ah, I guess I really could use a nap.    <br>
 <br>
Sometimes you just have to trust<br>
what your parents tell you.    <br>
 <br>
- It's in your best interest.<br>
- Yes, maybe you're right.    <br>
