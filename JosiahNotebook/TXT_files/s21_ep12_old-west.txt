Okay, kids, remember, it's Father's Day,   <br>
 <br>
which is the one day a year   <br>
 <br>
we have to pretend<br>
your dad's annoying habits   <br>
 <br>
are charming quirks.   <br>
 <br>
Here it comes, we get to watch<br>
him remove his mouth guard.   <br>
 <br>
Good morning, family.   <br>
 <br>
Let's see if I can break   <br>
 <br>
the nine-inch saliva string record.   <br>
 <br>
There it is, nine inches.   <br>
 <br>
Peter, that's two inches.   <br>
 <br>
Saliva starts at the taint, Lois.   <br>
 <br>
You always measure from the wrong place.   <br>
 <br>
- Brian?<br>
- Thank you.   <br>
 <br>
I'll just take that<br>
to the nibbling corner.   <br>
 <br>
BRIAN: Mmm. (MOANS WITH PLEASURE)   <br>
 <br>
Happy Father's Day, Dad.   <br>
 <br>
Okay, Peter, we have a special<br>
present for you this year.   <br>
 <br>
We thought you could have the whole day   <br>
 <br>
- to yourself...<br>
- Yes!   <br>
 <br>
...to do the Father's Day scavenger hunt   <br>
 <br>
I organized with the other wives.   <br>
 <br>
No!   <br>
 <br>
No! No!   <br>
 <br>
No! No!   <br>
 <br>
What was that?   <br>

My inner Al Pacino.   <br>
 <br>
Everybody has one.   <br>
 <br>
- I don't.<br>
- Sure you do.   <br>
 <br>
Since it's Father's Day,   <br>
 <br>
you have to do that thing<br>
in bed with me tonight.   <br>
 <br>
No!   <br>
 <br>
Huh, son of a bitch.   <br>
 <br>
Anyway, I thought<br>
a scavenger hunt would be fun.   <br>
 <br>
Dads don't want fun on Father's Day.   <br>
 <br>
They want to put<br>
their hand down their pants,   <br>
 <br>
and watch a guy from a weird country   <br>
 <br>
win a golf tournament.   <br>
 <br>
Who's ready to scavenger hunt?   <br>
 <br>
I'll be your guide today.   <br>
 <br>
Hop on and, uh,<br>
please excuse the clutter.   <br>
 <br>
I'm kind of Nomadland -ing it<br>
in this thing.   <br>
 <br>
Can I move this bucket?   <br>
 <br>
I wouldn't move or open any buckets.   <br>

handsy when you're drunk,    <br>

the jean shorts say you're impotent,    <br>

you stormed the Capitol.    <br>

In fact, my son was having a problem    <br>
 <br>
that maybe a good dad<br>
could help him solve.    <br>
 <br>
There's a girl I like at school,    <br>
 <br>
and I'm not sure if she likes me back.    <br>
 <br>
Now here's what you should do:    <br>
 <br>
You take out a hefty silver dollar,    <br>
 <br>
and you drop it in her corset.    <br>
 <br>
If it's meant to be, she'll accept you    <br>
 <br>
in a room full of<br>
distractingly floral wallpaper.    <br>
 <br>
If not, she'll s*ab you in the liver    <br>
 <br>
with your own boot Kn*fe.    <br>
 <br>
That's how I met my Pearl.    <br>
 <br>
I think you're ready.    <br>

I was only trying to help.    <br>

Yeah, David Geffen paid us $   million    <br>

as part of the settlement.    <br>

All I will say is from film,<br>

What's the matter, Peter?    <br>
 <br>
Ah, I don't know, I just feel bad    <br>
 <br>
about what happened with Old West.    <br>
 <br>
It's my fault he got arrested.    <br>
 <br>
He's probably gonna die in jail    <br>
 <br>
without ever making up with his son.    <br>
 <br>
Well, I know how painful it is    <br>
 <br>
to see a man you've known<br>
for    hours in distress,    <br>
 <br>
but you've got to let it go, Peter.    <br>
 <br>
I can't do that.<br>
Old West and I were partners,    <br>
 <br>
and he taught me that when<br>
you work a job with someone,    <br>
 <br>
you never leave a man behind.    <br>

He lives in L. A., right?<br>
Where does he live?    <br>

Um, hey, settle a bet for me, Bosch.    <br>

In all those scenes where<br>
you're in Italian restaurants,    <br>

is it true you're eating real spaghetti?    <br>

What?    <br>

Oh, did you say, "I'm never<br>
gonna get out of here?"    <br>
 <br>
No, I was telling my horse to get naked.    <br>
 <br>
Oh. Oh, well-well,<br>
we're breaking you out tonight.    <br>
 <br>
I'm surprised you came back for me.    <br>
