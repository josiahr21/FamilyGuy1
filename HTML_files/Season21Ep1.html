        <div>Lifeguard: See, guys? This is why no running. </div>
        <div>Peter:: And then... I know, it's still not over yet... I bought a squid boat. Lieutenant
            Dan was also working with me. And you know who's super helpful on a boat that's
            constantly rocking in the water? A wheelchair guy.</div>
        <div>Joe: Hey, Forrest, I got our lunches. </div>

        <div>Peter: So after I was rich, Jenny came back and had sex with me one time. Wow, that was great.
            Sorry I was naming presidents during. So, we getting married or what? </div>
        <div>Lois: You don't want to marry me, Forrest.</div>
        <div>Peter: Yeah, you're right. Okay, well, have a good night. </div>
        <div>Peter: And then, shockingly late in the movie, I started running again. Like, across the
            country. Several times. The whole sequence is a full eight minutes. I mean, sometimes
            this whole movie feels like it was written by a seven-year-old who just ate a bunch of
            candy. But I checked, it's just a regular guy. Anyway, at least we were finally to the
            time in our nation's history when I could listen to this. </div>
