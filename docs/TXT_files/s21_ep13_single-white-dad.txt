Chris, your mother and I
divided all our stuff    
  
after a recent argument,    
  
and I came across 
something very special:    
  
the Nintendo NES.    
  
This is a day I've been 
waiting for for    years,    
  
and now, I get to share it with my son.    
  
Get ready for the greatest

- This game sucks. 
- What are you talking about?    
  
Uh, what universe does this 
even take place in?    
  
Everything needs to take place 
in a universe.    
  
It's a warehouse with ladders 
where a monkey took a girl.    
  
What about the micro-transactions    
  
that slowly bankrupt our family?    
  
Or the children slinging r*cist 
taunts into your earpiece?    
  
It has two buttons, and I have 
to look down when I press them.    
  
Donkey Kong sucks.    
  
I could build the same game 
on our house.    
  
- (MUSIC STOPS) 
- Donkey Kong house?    
  
Sorry I put you in a dress, Stewie.    
  
- We needed a damsel. 
- Hey, do I look upset?    
  
What do we got today?    
  
Looks like a Donkey Kong house.    
  
(SIGHS) What a mess.    
  
- Want a beer? 
- Yes, sir.    
  
- Is that a YETI? 
- It is.    
  
You mind if I talk about it 
for    minutes?    
  
Oh, I know I can't stop you.

Barrel. Barrel.    
  
What is all this noise?    
  
I'm trying to buy everything 
on Amazon in here.    
  
PETER: Barrel.    
  
Ah! My foot. Oh, I think it's broken.    
  
Uh-oh. Next level.    
  
(IMITATES DONKEY KONG SOUND EFFECTS)    
  
(SIGHS) The doctor said 
I'm gonna be laid up for a week,    
  
so you'll have to take care of the kids,    
  
but that'll give you some quality time    
  
with them, huh? Are you excited?    
  
No, and you know that.    
  
Are you brushing with a grill brush?    
  
I left my toothbrush 
at a hotel three years ago.    
  
Look, now, don't worry, 
it's just a week,    
  
and taking care of kids 
is not that hard.    
  
The Facebook status of every girl    
  
I went to high school with 
would disagree.    
  
Plus, you know I'm not very good 
at taking care of things.    
  
Remember, I even lost custody 
of our orchid.    
  
Please, you can't take my baby.    
  
- How often did you water her? 
- Every day.    
  
- Every day? 
- I thought water was good.    
  
Not that much. What about sun?    
  
I put it in the front window.    
  
A western-facing window?    
  
That's direct, afternoon 
sunlight, you... monster!    
  
It's not worth it, O'Malley.    
  
Why do these guys get to have 
one while me and Molly...    
  
(SNIFFLES)    
  
Hey, it's gonna 
happen for you and Molly, I know it.    
  
Stress doesn't help.    
  
Why don't you guys come over tonight?    
  
We'll hang out on the patio.    
  
Yeah, okay. That sounds nice.    
  
Want me to bring anything?    
  
How about the food and the drinks?    
  
That feels like everything, but okay.    
  
Breakfast?    
  
You're supposed to make breakfast.    
  
Oh, right.    
  
(GROANS)    
  
Maybe we should go out for food.    
  
Having a little trouble this morning?    
  
No, no, I'm doing great.    
  
Look, I already got 
Stewie and Brian changed.    
  
BOTH: Ow.    
  
Okay, maybe I'm having 
a little trouble, but I'm a dad.    
  
The only thing I know 
how to use is a Shop-Vac.    
  
I already made myself some toast,    
  
so I don't need your help.    
  
Dads need to eat first.    
  
Get out.     
  
There's a grenade in here.     
  
Use it to get a better lunch.     
  
I got a sandwich in mine.     
  
You got the wrong bag.

Aw, crap, three kids.

I'm supposed to bring in.     
  
You're doing a great job, Dad.     
  
- So cute. 
- #DanceLikeADad.     
  
I'm waving to someone behind you.     
  
Wow, everybody's being so nice.     
  
Hey, we normally order at the counter,     
  
but it looks like you've got 
your hands full today.     
  
What can I get you?     
  
Can you stuff 
a blueberry muffin into a cup     
  
and pour coffee all over it?     
  
Normally, no, but I can't say 
"no" to a super dad like you.     
  
Where's this little guy's mom? 
Is she coming in, too?     
  
No, she's not with us.     
  
Oh, my, she's dead? I'm so sorry.     
  
Oh, actually...     
  
Is there anything else I can bring you?     
  
We make a great homemade 
banana cream pie.     
  
It's on the house.     
  
Uh... yeah.     
  
My wife is dead.     
  
I'll have that pie.     
  
- I'll bring it right away. 
- (SIGHS)     
  
- Is everything okay? 
- Uh...     
  
I'll never forget her last words,     
  
"Get free extra whipped cream 
on your Frappuccino."     
  
It already comes 
with a lot of whipped cream.     
  
(CRYING): She was very specific 
about more.     
  
There he is.     
  
How's the week going as the solo dad?     
  
And how is Lois' foot?     
  
I'm not rooting for her 
to lose it, but...     
  
Are you guys about to talk 
about your kids?     
  
You said I can look at my phone 
when you talk about your kids.     
  
This is the closest 
I've ever been to Mr. Quagmire.     
  
He's wearing makeup.     
  
You know, I thought this week 
was gonna suck,     
  
but everywhere I go people 
are super helpful and nice.     
  
That's because you're a dad alone.     
  
That's the closest thing 
people get to seeing a hero.     
  
It's right after wounded veteran     
  
or ugly person who sings well.     
  
Totally. A mom alone 
with her kids is a mess,     
  
but when a woman sees a dad 
doing the same thing,     
  
total panty dropper.     
  
Ew, Joe.     
  
I've also been lying 
about Lois being dead     
  
to get free things.     
  
- Thoughts? 
- What kind of free things?     
  
Pie, mostly.     
  
- Good pie? 
- Homemade.     
  
That's better than regular-made.     
  
Bonnie lies about me being dead 
all the time. You're fine.     
  
Just as long as you share 
that pie with Kirby here.     
  
- Right, little guy? 
- Who's Kirby?     
  
- Your son. Kirby. 
- His name is Stewie.     
  
Huh. Looks like a Kirby.     
  
No one looks like a Kirby.     
  
You'll see. I've never been 
wrong about a Kirby.     
  
(BELL RINGS)     
  
Peter? Can you come up here?     
  
Need something, Lois?     
  
Oh, well, I just need 
the Apple TV remote.     
  
Well, I am great at fetch. (LAUGHS)     
  
Just the remote, please.     
  
Whoa. Did you feel that?

A strong bond develops. Intimacy.     
  
Oh, maybe.     
  
Our fingers did touch 
when you handed me that remote.     
  
I know.     
  
You know, 
I've been in this bed for a long time.     
  
I... I sure could use a sponge bath.     
  
Oh, word?     
  
Why don't you start down by my cast?     
  
Oh, God, your leg is covered in hair.     
  
That's right. I can't shave down there     
  
'cause the cast will get wet.     
  
- Look at it. Smell it. 
- (GRUNTS) No.     
  
Take a deep breath and smell it.     
  
(SNIFFS) Ah! What is that?     
  
Four days of sweat and a dinner fork     
  
that got stuck 
when I scratched my ankle.     
  
Please, let me go.     
  
This English Patient enough for you?     
  
I don't know, I never saw it.

isn't a scenario

into the search bar of p*rn.     
  
- This is real life, and it stinks. 
- Please, let me go.     
  
Now, you listen to me.     
  
- Every    minutes, I'm gonna ring this bell... 
- (BELL RINGS)     
  
...and you're gonna come in 
and take out a bowl of my waste.     
  
If that's us forming a strong bond,     
  
then you and I are gonna form 
a very strong bond. Now, go.     
  
(WHIMPERS)     
  
(SNIFFS) Oh, buddy, 
this smells like a big one.     
  
You've been feeding me nothing 
but Chick-fil-A, so, yeah.

- A dad changing a diaper?     
  
No biting, Aidan.

- Hi. 
- Uh-oh.     
  
Do you own a gray Honda Accord?     
  
- No. 
- Okay, good.     
  
Good.     
  
My name's Becky, 
and this is my son, T. J.     
  
You're the single dad, whose wife is...     
  
Two feet under, yes. 
The shallow graves were cheaper.     
  
I was wondering if you wanted 
our kids to have a playdate.     
  
I know how hard it can be 
being a single parent.     
  
I can make some lunch, 
fire up the bounce house...     
  
We'll do it, we'll do it.     
  
Those two seem to be getting along well.     
  
Yeah. So, how long 
have you had a pet cloud?     
  
That's... a skylight.     
  
Does it bite?     
  
(LAUGHS)     
  
Do you want a beer? 
I can make some snacks,     
  
maybe pull out the 
popcorn machine for the kids.     
  
Or we don't tell them,     
  
and we keep all the popcorn 
for ourselves.     
  
(LAUGHS) You're fantastic.     
  
(LAUGHS) I'm... I'm-I'm serious, though.     
  
Hey, cheers.     
  
I'm glad we did this.     
  
Having to entertain 
a kid all day is exhausting.     
  
How long have you been doing it alone?     
  
- Ah, feels like forever. 
- Yeah, I know.     
  
Doesn't get any easier.     
  
I thought that after 
my late husband, Scott...     
  
(YAWNS) Huh?     
  
Hey, Mom, can I show Stewie my room?     
  
- Sure. 
- Yes! Come on, Stewie.     
  
Door open, bud.     
  
Dad.     
  
You know, we could make this 
a regular thing.     
  
It'll take the pressure off us 
having to entertain them.     
  
Yeah, I'd like that a lot. 
Oh, no, your pet cloud got out.     
  
That's a-a window.     
  
So... so it'll come back?     
  
- (FLY BUZZING) 
- Go away.     
  
- Stop it. Damn it. 
- (BELL RINGS)     
  
Need help, Mom?     
  
Can you get rid of this fly?     
  
There's a swatter in the 
top drawer of the dresser.     
  
Okay, that drawer is full of sex toys.     
  
Oh. Well, we must've moved 
the fly swatter.     
  
Uh, try the middle drawer.     
  
Is this a bit? Because that drawer     
  
is also filled to the brim 
with sex toys.     
  
Sorry. Look in the bottom drawer.     
  
Wrong again.     
  
(CRYING)     
  
These last few days have been 
really fun for me and T. J.     
  
I really like you, Peter.     
  
It's rare that you can relate to someone     
  
on a deeper level like we can.     
  
I know. Can I tell you something?     
  
I know this is crazy, and 
I-I don't use this word lightly,     
  
but I love the way you cut sandwiches.     
  
Perfect triangles. You're amazing.     
  
You're amazing, too.     
  
You've got a childish wonder about you,     
  
just like my late husband Scott,     
  
- who used... 
- (YAWNS) Huh?     
  
So, should we go back to my place?     
  
Keep the playdate going?     
  
Maybe take out the popcorn machine?     
  
Let me touch all the buttons.     
  
You can pour in the kernels.     
  
- You think I'm ready? 
- No,     
  
but I'll make sure you don't spill.     
  
(MOANS)     
  
I wonder what Scott would think of this.     
  
(SIGHS) Give her a break. 
She was acquitted.     
  
And then she kissed me.     
  
I don't know what to do.     
  
I guess lying about having 
a dead wife to eat popcorn     
  
wasn't the best idea.     
  
That's a nice story, Peter.     
  
Did anyone else break 
any sacraments this week?     
  
Well, there's two things 
you can do from here:     
  
break it off or go full scumbag.     
  
If you're interested in going 
scumbag, I sell a starter kit.     
  
It includes a second phone, 
fake addresses,     
  
and some golf shirts.     
  
- I don't golf. 
- Nobody does.     
  
Golf was invented purely     
  
so husbands can cheat on their wives.     
  
A six-hour game 
in a completely different town     
  
where you need special shirts? 
I-I don't think so.     
  
I was only hanging out 
with Becky to help with Stewie.     
  
She clearly saw it as something else.     
  
I got to break it off 
before Lois finds out.     
  
You need to break it off 'cause     
  
it's the right thing to do.     
  
When did you get glasses?     
  
You like them? They're Kirby Parkers.

You don't have to do this.

Yeah, it looks like it'll fit.     
  
It'll totally fit.     
  
Yeah, all right. Let's do it. $   .     
  
Heating pad.     
  
(LAUGHS) Ah, wonderful.     
  
(YELPS)     
  
Ugh, terrific.     
  
(STOMPING ON ROOF)     
  
(SCOFFS) Probably a prowler. 
It's cool, I know him.     
  
He'll just go right into my bed.     
  
- Hey. 
- Hey, Meg's eating dinner.     
  
That's cool, I'll wait.     
  
(LAUGHING): It's kind of my thing.     
  
How am I gonna get down?     
  
If you hold this feather, you can fly.     
  
Really? Wow, thanks, little rat.     
  
Ow! (GRUNTS)     
  
That's for putting locks 
on your garbage cans, you d*ck.     
  
(GASPS)     
  
Heating pad.     
  
Where did you go? And why was your box     
  
of boner and butt pills on the stairs?     
  
I almost tripped.     
  
Those are discreet.     
  
Now, let's get you back upstairs.     
  
(GASPS, GRUNTS)     
  
(GROANS) It's all right, Peter,     
  
- just open the Calm app. 
- (PHONE BEEPS)     
  
"Your credit card 
has been decli..." Whee!     
  
There you are, Peter. Are you okay?     
  
Is this your mother?     
  
I'm sorry. Who the hell are you, 
and why are you holding my baby?     
  
See? Total bitch, right?     
  
Boy, this-this is gonna be 
a really funny story     
  
when I tell you both separately 
far away from each other.     
  
- Hey, Mom. 
- Mom?     
  
Peter said you were dead.     
  
Dead? I am not dead.     
  
I was just recovering from foot surgery,     
  
so I put him in charge of the kids.     
  
- Now, what the hell happened? 
- Heating pad?     
  
I cannot believe this, Peter.     
  
You've been lying to me?     
  
I thought we had something.     
  
And what kind of a mother 
leaves their husband     
  
with the kids for a week? 
It is a miracle they're alive.     
  
- Excuse me? 
- I'll tell you what kind of mother,     
  
the best mom there is.     
  
I'm sorry I lied to you, Becky.     
  
All I wanted was free popcorn.     
  
Taking care of kids is relentless.     
  
There's no escape.     
  
You know, unless you 
"accidentally" leave them     
  
in a hot car.     
  
I mean, you'd get less jail time 
than actual m*rder, right?     
  
And-and prison has to be 
quieter than your actual life.     
  
Anyway, if I've learned 
anything this week,     
  
it's that all mothers are heroes,     
  
and the biggest hero I know     
  
is the one I'm lucky enough 
to call my wife.     
  
Oh, Peter,     
  
that almost cancels out 
everything you've done.     
  
Look, Becky, I don't blame you 
for what happened.     
  
Nobody does.     
  
But you're a beautiful woman,     
  
you can do better than a 
  -year-old morbidly obese guy.     
  
You know what, you're right.     
  
Ever since I lost 
my late husband Scott, I...     
  
GRIFFINS: (YAWNS) Huh?     
  
The other mom just left, and now,     
  
Bonnie's dragging a washing machine     
  
out from the bulkhead.     
  
(CHUCKLES) Never a dull moment.     
  
Hey, grab me a beer from the YETI.     
  
- You know it'll be cold, right? 
- Mm-hmm.     
  
Just picture it, the place: 
Dripping Springs, Texas.     
  
Roy and Ryan Seiders,     
  
brothers tired of their 
conventional coolers breaking     
  
when they would stand-cast 
into the Gulf Coast,     
  
took matters into their own hands     
  
and created the cooler 
to end all coolers.     
  
<em class="text-italics">ANNOUNCER: Yeti coolers:</em>     
  
<em class="text-italics">for the man in your life 
with no personality.</em>     
  
(SIGHS) Well, I'm glad 
my foot's all healed.     
  
It's so nice to be back downstairs.     
  
Yeah, and I'm happy our relationship     
  
is stronger than ever, and 
everything is back to normal.     
  
Well, except every time 
I look out the window,     
  
the beginning of "Kiss Me" 
by Sixpence None the Richer
