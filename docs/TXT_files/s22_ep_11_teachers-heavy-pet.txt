[VIDEO GAME CHEERING]

Welcome to the Adam West
High School homecoming game.

If anyone is here to sh**t the place up,

please do it after the halftime show.

The girls have worked very hard.

But first, join me as we say goodbye

to Adam West High's longest
serving teacher, Mr. Trampledon.

He's retiring after 50
years, and is known these days

as the last teacher in
school to employ a paddle

and/or closed fist on
misbehaving students.

He was formally asked to
stop doing that last week

and... decided just to retire.

And he'd better step lively or...

- [GRUNTS]
- [TEAM WHOOPING]

And... tonight's game is dedicated

to the memory of Mr. Trampledon.

And now, give it up for our
Homecoming King and Queen.

They're off to never leave town

and slowly decay before our eyes.

Next up, crowning our
Homecoming Dunce, Chris Griffin!

[ANNOUNCER] This is
Chris Griffin's fourth win

for Adam West High Homecoming Dunce,

even though he's only a sophomore.

[SIGHS] Four years in a row
is nothing to be proud of.

Dynasty.

[TV ANNOUNCER] We now return to Hulu's

Pam and Tommy. Lee Jones.

Baby, are you gonna steer
the boat with your penis?

Why would I engage in such foolishness?

How you feeling after yesterday, Chris?

Terrible. Every year
I'm the Homecoming Dunce,

and every year the bullying gets worse.

Hello, everyone. I have some news.

I got an email from the school saying

they're looking for a substitute teacher

to replace Mr. Trampledon,
and... I applied.

And they accepted.

- What?
- Seriously?

I don't know if that's
"mute the TV" news.

Mom, you can't!

Don't you need a
master's degree to teach?

A master's degree is needed,
and I told them I had one.

You lied?

I manifested success.

I'm a woman in her 40s, so I manifest.

Lying is just me taking
action steps over the truth.

The corpse of the truth.

You can't just say you're a teacher.

Oh, no? Every other man
these days throws on a dress

and suddenly he's a woman, so...

Okay, I met with community leaders,

and I'm going to learn and listen.

Anyway, I'm a teacher now.

You saw how unpopular I am at school.

Having my mother as a teacher
will make things worse.

I thought about that, Chris,

which is why I applied under
the name Lois Pewterschmidt.

But you've taught at Adam West before.

People won't fall for it.

Oh, maybe I'll wear a blonde wig?

[GASPS] Might even
add a sexy beauty mark

so I look like Marilyn Monroe.

Or Cindy Crawford? Or Eva Mendes?

Or Gabriel Macht? The guy from Suits?

That won't work. I don't want this.

- I'm going to Bonnie's room!
- You mean your room?

No, Bonnie's room.

Yeah, first Wednesday of every month,

Bonnie visits her mom in the home.

Oh.

You know, when she and I do this,

Yeah, well, uh, Bonnie's not here.

Glad to have you aboard,

Hey, stud. The cheerleading

We do that for all the boys who "score."

Wow. You guys decorated my locker?

Well, the male cheerleaders did.

We decorated it in what is known
as the Hollywood Regency Style.

A delightful blend of Art

Did you notice the pop of color?
The pop of color was my idea.

Hey, I heard a weird rumor about you.

Oh, that I took a trip to Jamaica

and my room was robbed of everything

except my camera and toothbrush?

And then I carried on
using my toothbrush,

as one does on vacation,
but when I got home,

I developed my film
and there was a picture

of a Jamaican man using
my Oral-B as his a**l-B?

Yeah, it sort of happened,

No, people are saying you're sleeping

with "Miss Pewterschmidt," who is Mom.

I know she's Mom.

And I may have said some things

that made people think we're having sex.

But the guys in class
now think I'm cool.

Chris, Mom could get arrested.

Mom knew when she took this job

there was a chance we'd
wind up pretend-banging.

I'm not going back to being unpopular.

Well, Chris, tell me just

Well, she has this whole
"mom" thing going on.

Last night, she scolded me

for tracking mud in the living room.

Obviously trying to
get me out of my shoes.

Ooh, what a turn-on.

That's not sex.

Tell us exactly what
sex you and she did.

[GULPS] Come on, Chris.

You've seen thousands of hours of p*rn.

You can do this.

Well, Miss Pewterschmidt was
a braless real estate agent

who was showing me a
large, mostly empty home

in Van Nuys, California,

and she'd do anything to make the sale.

I showed her a thick wad of
ones and we were off to the races

on a brown leather couch
next to an empty CD tower.

That's just p*rn.

Yeah, you're just making
this whole thing up.

No, we really had sex.

I mean, the house purchase
fell through, though,

because of some issues
with the appraisal,
