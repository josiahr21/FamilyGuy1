What house, Mom?    
  
The Airbnb in Nantucket    
  
we wanted for the Fourth of July.    
  
There was a cancellation, 
so I swooped right in    
  
and scooped it up. 
The Pelican strikes again.    
  
- "The Pelican"? 
- Yeah. Some people call me that    
  
'cause I swoop and scoop.    
  
- Who calls you that? 
- Some people.    
  
- Who? 
- It's really catching on.    
  
From who?    
  
Look, everybody just pack your bags    
  
because we leave tomorrow.    
  
I thought you said July  th? 
It's October.    
  
Yeah, but we always 
celebrate our holidays    
  
off-peak to save money.    
  
I don't know, this feels forced.    
  
Oh, come on, 
you kids are all getting older.    
  
We are running out of time to do 
stuff together as a family.    
  
Plus this is our first Airbnb.    
  
That's a huge mom milestone.    
  
You know, I heard that every 
time someone says "Airbnb,"    
  
a white woman can hear it 
from five miles away.    
  
Mm, sounds like 
the Pelican got her Airbnb.    
  
Who?!

Oh.     
  
That.     
  
Forgot to grab one for Chris,     
  
you absolute ancient hag.     
  
All right, Brian, if we're 
going to go door-to-door     
  
and sell all this, we need a game plan.     
  
So let's practice.     
  
You and I walk up to a client's house.     
  
Walking, walking, walking.     
  
We're walking, walking, walking.     
  
Oh.     
  
Up the steps and we knock on the door.     
  
Knock-knock. Nothing.     
  
Nothing... then they answer. Freeze!     
  
Now what do we tell 
the client we're selling?     
  
- Taffy. 
- Wrong.     
  
The first thing every salesman needs     
  
to sell is himself. Write it down.     
  
I didn't bring a pen or paper.     
  
All right, after we sell ourselves,     
  
what do we tell 
the client we're selling?     
  
- Taffy? 
- Wrong!     
  
Never tell the client 
what you're selling.     
  
The second you tell them 
what we're selling,     
  
- they'll know what we're selling. 
- Right.     
  
- Wrong! 
- Yeah, I might need a pen and paper.     
  
The second thing a salesman 
needs to sell is an emotion.     
  
All right, let's just skip 
ahead. I'll be the client. Okay.     
  
You've sold yourself... barely.     
  
You've sold an emotion: nostalgia.     
  
- Now what are you selling? 
- Taf...     
  
Don't you dare come to my house 
and tell me what you're selling.     
  
Yeah, I'm having a hard time 
tracking this.     
  
Oh, you're having a hard time?

Do you see my hand?     
  
This gesture says that I'm in

So, Mom, did you ever find out     
  
what was stolen from 
that Nantucket house?

- Never is.     
  
It was a bottle of shampoo 
I must have packed in my bag.     
  
Oh, no way.     
  
You did it? (LAUGHS)     
  
How does your fat foot taste, Mom?     
  
Apparently taking the rest 
of a tiny bottle of shampoo     
  
is considered stealing nowadays.     
  
Answer the question about the foot.     
  
- How big was the bottle? 
- Ah, it was small.     
  
I thought you said it was "tiny."     
  
Would it pass through airport security?     
  
- That's the threshold. 
- It was very little.     
  
Oh, now it's "little."     
  
You're all over the place.

I hated tonight's chicken.     
  
I am not wrong here, okay?     
  
We paid a lot of money for that house,     
  
and taking the ass-end 
of a shampoo bottle     
  
barely makes a dent into their haul.

your mother always describes

This is terrible, Brian.     
  
We've barely sold any boxes.     
  
Nobody likes taffy.     
  
Yeah, I guess without 
the salt air and ocean views,     
  
it's just subpar gum.     
  
What are we gonna do? We sunk 
a lot of money into this.     
  
We need to pivot.     
  
It's not selling as candy,     
  
so we need to repackage it as something     
  
people actually want.     
  
Let's brainstorm.     
  
Okay. Hmm.     
  
You know, I'm-I'm really not 
liking your brainstorming face.     
  
Very unlikable eyebrow movement.     
  
Shh! I got it, I got it.     
  
Colored layered sand in bottles.     
  
That's a whole different bad idea.     
  
Okay, what about bottles 
with layered sand in it     
  
that's different colors?     
  
That's the same thing 
except with the words     
  
in a different order.     
  
We're never gonna sell all this stuff     
  
unless we can find 
a big enough group of suckers     
  
to trick into taking it off our hands.     
  
Welp, we found 'em!     
  
Stewie, rebranding this taffy     
  
as Chew Anon was a stroke of genius.     
  
Yep, and when we told Joe Rogan     
  
it cured COVID, we were off.     
  
God bless our stupid, stupid country.     
  
(THUNDER CRASHES)     
  
Hello, Dottie.     
  
Lois? What are you doing here?     
  
Well, I brought your dinner.     
  
And... delivery complete.     
  
Oh, well, would you look at that.     
  
It looks like it's my turn 
to give someone a review.     
  
What?     
  
After every delivery, 
drivers get to rate     
  
their experience with the customer.     
  
(GASPS) Wouldn't it be a shame     
  
if one of only two DoorDash drivers     
  
on the island gave you a poor review?     
  
(GASPS) Well, they might ban 
you from the app, Dottie.     
  
You might actually have 
to leave the house     
  
for food during the winter season.     
  
Okay, what do you want, money?     
  
No, no, no, no, no.     
  
Here's what's gonna happen, Dottie.     
  
You're gonna take out your phone,     
  
open up Airbnb,     
  
then change that review.     
  
Okay.     
  
Type the following: "Would."     
  
- Would... 
- "Host."     
  
- Host. 
- "Again."     
  
- Again. 
- Send.     
  
So that's it?     
  
- This is over? 
- That's it.     
  
This is over.     
  
You know what, Dottie?     
  
I did steal that shampoo.     
  
You did?     
  
You're damn right I did!     
  
I was always gonna steal that shampoo.     
  
And do you know why?     
  
Because when I stood in your shower     
  
and rubbed that 
peach orchard-scented bottle     
  
of bliss into my hair, 
I felt like somebody else.     
  
I felt like somebody who mattered.     
  
Somebody who had enough disposable cash     
  
that she could buy a scented shampoo.     
  
That's what Airbnbs do, Dottie.     
  
They make you feel like 
you're living a fairy tale life.     
  
And I wanted that feeling to last.     
  
And it did!     
  
Also, I opened your locked closet     
  
and put on your wedding dress. 
I ate yogurt in it.     
  
Oh, my God.     
  
Yeah, oh, my God.     
  
Because that's what Lois Griffin does.     
  
Really, I should be thanking you 
for reminding me of who I am:     
  
a secret little psycho 
with very little to lose.     
  
And there's a million of us out there,     
  
and you're just welcoming 
us all into your homes.     
  
So if you ever think of giving someone     
  
a bad review again, remember this.     
  
We know where you live.     
  
<em class="text-italics">ANNOUNCER: Airbnb. What are you doing?!</em>     
  
<em class="text-italics">It's your house!</em>     
  
- Well, it all worked out. 
- What?     
  
Oh, I said it all worked out.     
  
I got my reputation back on Airbnb,     
  
and Dottie got her comeuppance.     
  
I don't know what you're 
talking about, and I don't care.     
  
Oh. I just thought we could share     
  
some conversation to pass the time.     
  
You're the lady who yelled 
at me in the coffee shop.     
  
You think I give a crap 
about anything you have to say?     
  
Kind of thought you'd have 
a helicopter, James Taylor.
