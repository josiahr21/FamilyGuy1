What house, Mom?   <br>
 <br>
The Airbnb in Nantucket   <br>
 <br>
we wanted for the Fourth of July.   <br>
 <br>
There was a cancellation,<br>
so I swooped right in   <br>
 <br>
and scooped it up.<br>
The Pelican strikes again.   <br>
 <br>
- "The Pelican"?<br>
- Yeah. Some people call me that   <br>
 <br>
'cause I swoop and scoop.   <br>
 <br>
- Who calls you that?<br>
- Some people.   <br>
 <br>
- Who?<br>
- It's really catching on.   <br>

From who?   <br>

Look, everybody just pack your bags   <br>

It's October.   <br>
 <br>
Yeah, but we always<br>
celebrate our holidays   <br>
 <br>
off-peak to save money.   <br>
 <br>
I don't know, this feels forced.   <br>
 <br>
Oh, come on,<br>
you kids are all getting older.   <br>
 <br>
We are running out of time to do<br>
stuff together as a family.   <br>
 <br>
Plus this is our first Airbnb.   <br>
 <br>
That's a huge mom milestone.   <br>
 <br>
You know, I heard that every<br>
time someone says "Airbnb,"   <br>
 <br>
a white woman can hear it<br>
from five miles away.   <br>

Mm, sounds like<br>
the Pelican got her Airbnb.   <br>

- That makes no sense.<br>
- In what way?   <br>

We don't know what the choices are,   <br>
 <br>
so how can we definitively say,<br>
"But first, coffee"?   <br>
 <br>
But that's the point. It doesn't matter.   <br>

Whatever it is, "First, coffee."   <br>

you absolute ancient hag.    <br>
 <br>
All right, Brian, if we're<br>
going to go door-to-door    <br>
 <br>
and sell all this, we need a game plan.    <br>
 <br>
So let's practice.    <br>
 <br>
You and I walk up to a client's house.    <br>
 <br>
Walking, walking, walking.    <br>
 <br>
We're walking, walking, walking.    <br>
 <br>
Oh.    <br>
 <br>
Up the steps and we knock on the door.    <br>
 <br>
Knock-knock. Nothing.    <br>
 <br>
Nothing... then they answer. Freeze!    <br>
 <br>
Now what do we tell<br>
the client we're selling?    <br>
 <br>
- Taffy.<br>
- Wrong.    <br>
 <br>
The first thing every salesman needs    <br>
 <br>
to sell is himself. Write it down.    <br>
 <br>
I didn't bring a pen or paper.    <br>
 <br>
All right, after we sell ourselves,    <br>
 <br>
what do we tell<br>
the client we're selling?    <br>
 <br>
- Taffy?<br>
- Wrong!    <br>
 <br>
Never tell the client<br>
what you're selling.    <br>
 <br>
The second you tell them<br>
what we're selling,    <br>
 <br>
- they'll know what we're selling.<br>
- Right.    <br>
 <br>
- Wrong!<br>
- Yeah, I might need a pen and paper.    <br>
 <br>
The second thing a salesman<br>
needs to sell is an emotion.    <br>
 <br>
All right, let's just skip<br>
ahead. I'll be the client. Okay.    <br>
 <br>
You've sold yourself... barely.    <br>
 <br>
You've sold an emotion: nostalgia.    <br>

- Now what are you selling?<br>

what was stolen from<br>
that Nantucket house?    <br>

- I did. Funny story.<br>
- Never is.    <br>

It was a bottle of shampoo<br>
I must have packed in my bag.    <br>

Oh, no way.    <br>

You did it? (LAUGHS)    <br>
 <br>
How does your fat foot taste, Mom?    <br>

Apparently taking the rest<br>
of a tiny bottle of shampoo    <br>
 <br>
is considered stealing nowadays.    <br>
 <br>
Answer the question about the foot.    <br>
 <br>
- How big was the bottle?<br>
- Ah, it was small.    <br>
 <br>
I thought you said it was "tiny."    <br>
 <br>
Would it pass through airport security?    <br>

- That's the threshold.<br>
- It was very little.    <br>

Oh, now it's "little."    <br>

The size is misleading.    <br>

There was barely any liquid left in it.    <br>

It was sputtering to a finish.    <br>

That bell was the only item recovered    <br>

from a shipwreck<br>
that devastated our island.    <br>

Entire families were torn apart, and...    <br>

Okay. You win, Dottie.    <br>

You got your shampoo back    <br>

This is terrible, Brian.    <br>
 <br>
We've barely sold any boxes.    <br>
 <br>
Nobody likes taffy.    <br>
 <br>
Yeah, I guess without<br>
the salt air and ocean views,    <br>
 <br>
it's just subpar gum.    <br>
 <br>
What are we gonna do? We sunk<br>
a lot of money into this.    <br>
 <br>
We need to pivot.    <br>
 <br>
It's not selling as candy,    <br>
 <br>
so we need to repackage it as something    <br>
 <br>
people actually want.    <br>
 <br>
Let's brainstorm.    <br>
 <br>
Okay. Hmm.    <br>
 <br>
You know, I'm-I'm really not<br>
liking your brainstorming face.    <br>
 <br>
Very unlikable eyebrow movement.    <br>
 <br>
Shh! I got it, I got it.    <br>
 <br>
Colored layered sand in bottles.    <br>
 <br>
That's a whole different bad idea.    <br>
 <br>
Okay, what about bottles<br>
with layered sand in it    <br>
 <br>
that's different colors?    <br>
 <br>
That's the same thing<br>
except with the words    <br>
 <br>
in a different order.    <br>
 <br>
We're never gonna sell all this stuff    <br>
 <br>
unless we can find<br>
a big enough group of suckers    <br>
 <br>
to trick into taking it off our hands.    <br>
 <br>
Welp, we found 'em!    <br>
 <br>
Stewie, rebranding this taffy    <br>
 <br>
as Chew Anon was a stroke of genius.    <br>
 <br>
Yep, and when we told Joe Rogan    <br>
 <br>
it cured COVID, we were off.    <br>

God bless our stupid, stupid country.    <br>

(THUNDER CRASHES)    <br>
 <br>
Hello, Dottie.    <br>
 <br>
Lois? What are you doing here?    <br>
 <br>
Well, I brought your dinner.    <br>
 <br>
And... delivery complete.    <br>
 <br>
Oh, well, would you look at that.    <br>
 <br>
It looks like it's my turn<br>
to give someone a review.    <br>
 <br>
What?    <br>
 <br>
After every delivery,<br>
drivers get to rate    <br>
 <br>
their experience with the customer.    <br>
 <br>
(GASPS) Wouldn't it be a shame    <br>
 <br>
if one of only two DoorDash drivers    <br>
 <br>
on the island gave you a poor review?    <br>
 <br>
(GASPS) Well, they might ban<br>
you from the app, Dottie.    <br>
 <br>
You might actually have<br>
to leave the house    <br>
 <br>
for food during the winter season.    <br>
 <br>
Okay, what do you want, money?    <br>
 <br>
No, no, no, no, no.    <br>
 <br>
Here's what's gonna happen, Dottie.    <br>
 <br>
You're gonna take out your phone,    <br>
 <br>
open up Airbnb,    <br>
 <br>
then change that review.    <br>
 <br>
Okay.    <br>
 <br>
Type the following: "Would."    <br>
 <br>
- Would...<br>
- "Host."    <br>
 <br>
- Host.<br>
- "Again."    <br>
 <br>
- Again.<br>
- Send.    <br>
 <br>
So that's it?    <br>
 <br>
- This is over?<br>
- That's it.    <br>
 <br>
This is over.    <br>
 <br>
You know what, Dottie?    <br>
 <br>
I did steal that shampoo.    <br>
 <br>
You did?    <br>
 <br>
You're damn right I did!    <br>
 <br>
I was always gonna steal that shampoo.    <br>
 <br>
And do you know why?    <br>
 <br>
Because when I stood in your shower    <br>
 <br>
and rubbed that<br>
peach orchard-scented bottle    <br>
 <br>
of bliss into my hair,<br>
I felt like somebody else.    <br>
 <br>
I felt like somebody who mattered.    <br>
 <br>
Somebody who had enough disposable cash    <br>
 <br>
that she could buy a scented shampoo.    <br>
 <br>
That's what Airbnbs do, Dottie.    <br>
 <br>
They make you feel like<br>
you're living a fairy tale life.    <br>
 <br>
And I wanted that feeling to last.    <br>
 <br>
And it did!    <br>
 <br>
Also, I opened your locked closet    <br>
 <br>
and put on your wedding dress.<br>
I ate yogurt in it.    <br>
 <br>
Oh, my God.    <br>
 <br>
Yeah, oh, my God.    <br>
 <br>
Because that's what Lois Griffin does.    <br>
 <br>
Really, I should be thanking you<br>
for reminding me of who I am:    <br>
 <br>
a secret little psycho<br>
with very little to lose.    <br>
 <br>
And there's a million of us out there,    <br>
 <br>
and you're just welcoming<br>
us all into your homes.    <br>
 <br>
So if you ever think of giving someone    <br>
 <br>
a bad review again, remember this.    <br>
 <br>
We know where you live.    <br>
 <br>
<em class="text-italics">ANNOUNCER: Airbnb. What are you doing?!</em>    <br>

<em class="text-italics">It's your house!</em>    <br>
 <br>
- Well, it all worked out.<br>
- What?    <br>
 <br>
Oh, I said it all worked out.    <br>
 <br>
I got my reputation back on Airbnb,    <br>
 <br>
and Dottie got her comeuppance.    <br>
 <br>
I don't know what you're<br>
talking about, and I don't care.    <br>
 <br>
Oh. I just thought we could share    <br>
 <br>
some conversation to pass the time.    <br>
 <br>
You're the lady who yelled<br>
at me in the coffee shop.    <br>
 <br>
You think I give a crap<br>
about anything you have to say?    <br>
 <br>
Kind of thought you'd have<br>
a helicopter, James Taylor.    <br>
