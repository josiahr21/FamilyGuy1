Okay, kids, remember, it's Father's Day,    
  
which is the one day a year    
  
we have to pretend 
your dad's annoying habits    
  
are charming quirks.    
  
Here it comes, we get to watch 
him remove his mouth guard.    
  
Good morning, family.    
  
Let's see if I can break    
  
the nine-inch saliva string record.    
  
There it is, nine inches.    
  
Peter, that's two inches.    
  
Saliva starts at the taint, Lois.    
  
You always measure from the wrong place.    
  
- Brian? 
- Thank you.    
  
I'll just take that 
to the nibbling corner.    
  
BRIAN: Mmm. (MOANS WITH PLEASURE)    
  
Happy Father's Day, Dad.    
  
Okay, Peter, we have a special 
present for you this year.    
  
We thought you could have the whole day    
  
- to yourself... 
- Yes!    
  
...to do the Father's Day scavenger hunt    
  
I organized with the other wives.    
  
No!    
  
No! No!

What was that?    
  
My inner Al Pacino.    
  
Everybody has one.    
  
- I don't. 
- Sure you do.    
  
Since it's Father's Day,    
  
you have to do that thing 
in bed with me tonight.    
  
No!    
  
Huh, son of a bitch.    
  
Anyway, I thought 
a scavenger hunt would be fun.    
  
Dads don't want fun on Father's Day.    
  
They want to put 
their hand down their pants,    
  
and watch a guy from a weird country    
  
win a golf tournament.    
  
Who's ready to scavenger hunt?    
  
I'll be your guide today.    
  
Hop on and, uh, 
please excuse the clutter.    
  
I'm kind of Nomadland -ing it

I wouldn't move or open any buckets.

and you drop it in her corset.

in a room full of 
distractingly floral wallpaper.     
  
If not, she'll s*ab you in the liver     
  
with your own boot Kn*fe.

for Clam Karaoke Night:     
  
it's the "Glam Guys."     
  
All right, let's go rock Wilson Phillips     
  
and then do the posse thing.     
  
Where's your horse?     
  
It's very hard to get 
a horse last-minute.     
  
You should have called last night.     
  
I did. You all got the last horses.     
  
The guy was totally 
overwhelmed on the phone.     
  
He yelled at me.     
  
All right, Peter, what's the plan?     
  
I thought you guys 
were gonna have the plan.     
  
I formed the posse.     
  
Yeah, those usually go together.     
  
All right, let's brainstorm.     
  
How do we fool the police     
  
into breaking someone 
out of a jail cell?     
  
Trojan Bosch.     
  
Oh, no way, Harry Bosch. 
My favorite TV cop.     
  
I have so many questions for you.     
  
How's L. A.? You ever 
meet Richard Dean Anderson?     
  
He lives in L. A., right? 
Where does he live?     
  
Um, hey, settle a bet for me, Bosch.     
  
In all those scenes where 
you're in Italian restaurants,     
  
is it true you're eating real spaghetti?     
  
- PETER: Shut up. 
- I knew it was real spaghetti.     
  
All right, I'm gonna go 
get us some coffees.     
  
You mind holding down 
the fort for a sec?     
  
Thanks, Bosch.     
  
Real spaghetti. Wow.     
  
PETER: He's gone. Everybody 
out the black jeans door.     
  
Straight flush. You got to strip.     
  
PETER: What about tonight?     
  
What?     
  
Oh, did you say, "I'm never 
gonna get out of here?"     
  
No, I was telling my horse to get naked.     
  
Oh. Oh, well-well, 
we're breaking you out tonight.     
  
I'm surprised you came back for me.     
  
You taught me to never 
leave another man behind.     
  
I didn't think you'd remember.     
  
I associate you with g*ns, 
g*ns make me think of w*r,     
  
Vietnam was a w*r,     
  
and N.A.M. is "Never Abandon Man."     
  
I-I don't need to hear the process.     
  
Allen, you came.     
  
Of course I did.     
  
And I think margs are gonna be on you     
  
after this adventure, huh?     
  
I don't drink that (BLEEP).     
  
Okay, we'll figure something out.     
  
Everyone wanted to help.     
  
We even got a member of 
your original posse to show up.     
  
The Melanoma Kid.     
  
(THROUGH ELECTROLARYNX): 
I wouldn't miss it...     
  
(GASPS)     
  
...for the world.     
  
That's a guy?     
  
I thought it was a big autumn leaf.     
  
Sorry, Bosch, we ran out of milk,     
  
so I put in a dollop of cream cheese.     
  
Had to stir a lot, so...     
  
Tell me about your hooker mom.     
  
What was that like?     
  
What the hell happened in here, Bosch?     
  
Wait a minute. Frozen expression,     
  
painted-on clothes, open ass door.

I'm gonna need you boys

Mayor West, we broke him out for you.     
  
Can't you see he wants 
to make things right?     
  
There's only one person 
he's ever cared about,     
  
and it's himself.     
  
He's done walking out of towns 
consequence-free.     
  
I knew once I broke out 
that I'd see you again.     
  
Maybe I do deserve     
  
to spend my remaining days 
in a jail cell.     
  
And I'll let you take me,     
  
but not until I say what I have to say.     
  
Say it, then. Why'd you leave us?     
  
Because if I stayed,     
  
you would have grown up 
to be just like your father,     
  
a lonely, loveless, no-good outlaw.     
  
I wanted you to be a better man 
than I ever could be.     
  
And look at you now. 
Tell me it didn't work.
