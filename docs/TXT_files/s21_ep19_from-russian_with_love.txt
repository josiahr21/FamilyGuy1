- Oh, they seem to be doing okay.   <br>
 <br>
Hey, can you guys keep it down?<br>
I'm about to go on IG Live.   <br>
 <br>
Like I said, "IG Live."   <br>
 <br>
All right, Meg's going<br>
for her phone. She...   <br>
 <br>
Uhp, no, she's just scratching herself.   <br>
 <br>
Well, uh, anyway,<br>
if-if you guys are gonna join,   <br>
 <br>
just go into another room,<br>
or I'll get interference.   <br>
 <br>
Other than that, uh...   <br>
 <br>
I don't know, just buckle up<br>
and enjoy the ride.   <br>
 <br>
Oh, and I tagged Kurt Vonnegut's nephew,   <br>
 <br>
so just... just be cool on there.   <br>
 <br>
Boy, he's sure living<br>
a lot longer than we expected.   <br>
 <br>
Going live in three, two, one.   <br>
 <br>
(HOWLS) What's up, IG Live?!   <br>
 <br>
It's Brian Griffin, and<br>
you are live in the "Dog House."   <br>
 <br>
Okay, no viewers yet. I'll do it again.   <br>
 <br>
Hopefully I can keep that energy.   <br>
 <br>
Uhp, got my first viewer.   <br>
 <br>
Whoa! Getting a little crowded in here.   <br>
 <br>
And @BuyCryptoKid   has<br>
left the building.   <br>
 <br>
All right, welcome @WinACarAskMeHow.   <br>
 <br>
And we got @LearnGuitarln Days<br>
on the line.   <br>
 <br>
Let's get started.   <br>
 <br>
What I'm sure is on both your minds is:   <br>
 <br>
what is the "hero's journey"?   <br>
 <br>
Well, that's a question pondered<br>
by writers for many, many...   <br>
 <br>
Welcome, @Gain Inchesln Week...<br>
Many years.   <br>
 <br>
Let me recap what we've learned so far.   <br>
 <br>
Writer, "hero's journey,"<br>
many, many, many years.   <br>
 <br>
On the page that seemed<br>
like eight minutes of material.   <br>
 <br>
Should we bail him out with a question?   <br>
 <br>
No, we're not gonna<br>
bail him out with a question.   <br>
 <br>
We're gonna... You know what?   <br>
 <br>
I will ask him a question.<br>
Give me your phone.   <br>
 <br>
(NOTIFICATION POPS)   <br>
 <br>
(GASPS) We're gonna take a quick break.   <br>
 <br>
Hey, guys, I brought in your paper.   <br>
 <br>
Why do you get the newspaper<br>
if you're not gonna read it?   <br>
 <br>
Eh, sometimes I use it<br>
to punctuate my sentences.   <br>
 <br>
Well, anyway, I have a proposal<br>
for the two of you.   <br>
 <br>
Well, this ought to be interesting.   <br>
 <br>
Are the two of you free tonight<br>
for a double date?   <br>
 <br>
I'm seeing this girl, and<br>
I think she's something special.   <br>
 <br>
I want you to meet her.   <br>
 <br>
Oh, Glenn, that's wonderful.   <br>
 <br>
A-And you're sure she's not<br>
a sex worker this time?   <br>
 <br>
No, I-I'm pretty sure.   <br>
 <br>
I've offered her money many<br>
times, and she hasn't taken it.   <br>
 <br>
A double date sounds great.<br>
We'd love to go.   <br>
 <br>
(SINGSONGY): Ooh,<br>
the Quag's got a girlfriend.   <br>
 <br>
Ah! Get off me! We don't have<br>
that kind of relationship.   <br>
 <br>
Shoo! Go on, Meg!<br>
Get away from the house guest!   <br>
 <br>
Get away from the house guest!   <br>

Well, what's your paper of<br>

Exactly.   <br>

(GASPS) Oh, my God! It's her!   <br>
 <br>
- What? It's who?<br>
- Quagmire's girlfriend is   <br>
 <br>
my old junior high school bully,<br>
Stephanie.   <br>
 <br>
She made my life a living hell.   <br>
 <br>
Oh, see, that guy's wearing sandals.   <br>
 <br>
I could've worn mine.   <br>
 <br>
Peter, you don't know this   <br>
 <br>
because you met me in high school,   <br>
 <br>
but middle school was a<br>
painfully awkward phase for me.   <br>
 <br>
(LIVELY CHATTER)   <br>

<em class="text-italics">I had horrible acne,<br>

 <br>
- (POPS)<br>
- (GASPING)    <br>
 <br>
Stephanie never even apologized,<br>
and junior high trauma    <br>
 <br>
is something you don't recover from.    <br>
 <br>
Yeah, my gym teacher drove me<br>
home without his pants on,    <br>
 <br>
but your story sounds bad, too.    <br>
 <br>
Well, looks like all that<br>
hard work is finally paying off.    <br>
 <br>
I got verified on Instagram.    <br>
 <br>
Look at that, a blue check.    <br>
 <br>
Blue check? That's green.    <br>
 <br>
Brian, you got hacked.    <br>
 <br>
That's ridiculous.    <br>
 <br>
Someone DM'd me and said    <br>
 <br>
they just needed<br>
my mother's maiden name,    <br>
 <br>
the last four numbers of my credit card,    <br>
 <br>
and the first    numbers<br>
of my credit card.    <br>
 <br>
Then they responded right away with,    <br>
 <br>
"Thank you, comploted."    <br>
 <br>
Huh.    <br>
 <br>
That's not how you spell "completed."    <br>
 <br>
- (PHONE RINGS)<br>
- It's my credit card company.    <br>
 <br>
Hello?    <br>
 <br>
No, that wasn't me.    <br>
 <br>
No. No. Ma'am,<br>
I wouldn't know what to do    <br>
 <br>
with that many Tommy Hilfiger T-shirts.    <br>
 <br>
- Yuck.<br>
- (PHONE BEEPS)    <br>
 <br>
Okay, you were right. I got hacked.    <br>
 <br>
I'm so mad,<br>
that hacker has me seeing gray.    <br>
 <br>
Red. It's red, Brian.    <br>
 <br>
Why are you so upset?    <br>
 <br>
You already canceled your credit card.    <br>
 <br>
This hacker is destroying my Instagram.    <br>
 <br>
I have a brand.    <br>
 <br>
Posting Steve Harvey stand-up jokes    <br>
 <br>
is actually Steve Harvey's brand.    <br>
 <br>
I think you should just<br>
give your account to the hacker.    <br>
 <br>
I mean, your Instagram wasn't<br>
setting the world on fire.    <br>
 <br>
And I suppose<br>
the hacker's posts are better?    <br>
 <br>
Look at this, it's just<br>
a half a bottle of vodka    <br>
 <br>
that says, <em class="text-italics">"Eto vodka-chas gde-to."</em>    <br>
 <br>
Brian, what does that even mean?    <br>
 <br>
Hit "See translation."    <br>
 <br>
"It's vodka o'clock somewhere."    <br>
 <br>
(LAUGHING): Oh,<br>
that's very funny. That's very funny.    <br>
 <br>
You know, I've heard<br>
it's "wine o'clock,"    <br>
 <br>
but I've never heard it with vodka.    <br>
 <br>
That's what... That's-that's<br>
whip smart is what that is.    <br>
 <br>
No! No, it's not!    <br>
 <br>
Stewie, I need to get my account back.    <br>
 <br>
I-I may have sent<br>
some weird DMs to Zendaya    <br>
 <br>
that I'd rather<br>
not see the light of day.    <br>
 <br>
Euphoria Zendaya or Disney Zendaya?    <br>
 <br>
Yeah, a little from column A,<br>
a little from column B.    <br>
 <br>
We need to get that account back.    <br>
 <br>
Lois Pewterschmidt, what a small world.    <br>
 <br>
Nice to see you, too.    <br>
 <br>
You have aged infuriatingly well.    <br>
 <br>
So, how did you two meet?    <br>
 <br>
Did you both escape<br>
from the same sex cult?    <br>
 <br>
Sex cults sound terrible,    <br>
 <br>
but also, how do I get invited to one?    <br>
 <br>
- You tell it.<br>
- No, you tell it.    <br>
 <br>
No, you just tell it.    <br>
 <br>
- No, you. Fine, I'll go.<br>
- No, you, you go.    <br>
 <br>
(BOTH LAUGHING)    <br>
 <br>
Okay, Tinder.    <br>
 <br>
Huh, didn't really need<br>
that whole parade.    <br>
 <br>
And how did you two meet?    <br>
 <br>
Lois was dating another guy,<br>
and I threatened to k*ll myself.    <br>
 <br>
Lois, remember you had that back brace    <br>
 <br>
everyone said made you look like<br>
an ironing board in a sweater?    <br>
 <br>
(GIGGLES) Say more stuff.    <br>
 <br>
You were a nerd? I thought<br>
you said you were a prom queen.    <br>
 <br>
Prawn Queen.    <br>
 <br>
She ate a lot of shellfish,    <br>
 <br>
and her back was curved liked a shrimp.    <br>
 <br>
(GIGGLES) I've never meant this before,    <br>
 <br>
but we should do this again.    <br>
 <br>
Kids were so mean back then.    <br>
 <br>
Well, I barely remember those years.    <br>
 <br>
Peter and I have three lovely kids.    <br>
 <br>
They're a lot happier since<br>
you're allowed to be fat now.    <br>
 <br>
Being a mom is the most<br>
fulfilling job in the world.    <br>
 <br>
Oh, do you have kids?    <br>
 <br>
Be careful how you answer this.    <br>
 <br>
Oh, I wish I did,<br>
but after medical school,    <br>
 <br>
then a four-year residency,<br>
a two-year specialty,    <br>
 <br>
three years in Central America<br>
with Doctors Without Borders...    <br>
 <br>
Okay. Well, I'm sure<br>
all those achievements    <br>
 <br>
will come visit you<br>
when you're on your death bed.    <br>
 <br>
Excuse me, some of<br>
the other diners have complained    <br>
 <br>
that you're not talking loudly enough.    <br>
 <br>
They're loving these stories<br>
about how she was a nerd.    <br>
 <br>
It was "prawn queen"! Like the shrimp!    <br>
 <br>
MAN: Oh, that's even funnier!    <br>
 <br>
(CHUCKLES) You know what?    <br>
 <br>
I feel sorry for Stephanie now.    <br>
 <br>
Really? What part?<br>
The good skin or the great job?    <br>
 <br>
Oh, pfft. "Great job."    <br>
 <br>
Anyone can be a doctor in Ecuador.    <br>
 <br>
You think they're checking diplomas?    <br>
 <br>
And she doesn't have any kids.    <br>
 <br>
Probably can't. You know why? GMOs.    <br>
 <br>
Just gonna run this light real quick.    <br>
 <br>
- (ENGINE REVS)<br>
- (HORN HONKS)    <br>
 <br>
Settle down.    <br>
 <br>
I mean, I ate way better<br>
than she was eating.    <br>
 <br>
Did you see I ordered a salad?    <br>
 <br>
It was a wedge that was mostly<br>
bleu cheese and bacon.    <br>
 <br>
It was listed under "salad."    <br>
 <br>
But did you notice Stephanie<br>
ordered french fries?    <br>
 <br>
French fries, no kids, you do the math.    <br>
 <br>
Anyway, point is, I won dinner.    <br>
 <br>
- (HORN HONKS)<br>
- Settle down.    <br>
 <br>
I mean, you-you think<br>
I won dinner, right, Peter?    <br>
 <br>
Well, you did eat a lot faster than her.    <br>
 <br>
And-and now that I think about it,    <br>
 <br>
after she said I looked "good,"<br>
she looked right at my hands.    <br>
 <br>
What does that mean? Age comes<br>
out in the hands, Peter.    <br>
 <br>
Maybe she's trying to figure out<br>
how old I am!    <br>
 <br>
Well, but she knows how old I am.    <br>
 <br>
(GASPS) I bet she was judging<br>
my tiny wedding ring.    <br>
 <br>
Why was she looking at my hands, Peter?!    <br>
 <br>
I think your thumb was in the butter.    <br>
 <br>
But did she see that?    <br>
 <br>
I don't know, but<br>
nobody ate butter after that,    <br>
 <br>
so yeah, probably.    <br>
 <br>
I love that she had to ask<br>
what "caprese" was.    <br>
 <br>
What a dumb bitch.    <br>
 <br>
What-What's going on with your face?    <br>
 <br>
(LAUGHS): I don't know<br>
what you're talking about.    <br>
 <br>
Maybe-maybe it's a giant grin, huh?    <br>
 <br>
From having triumphed<br>
over my former bully!    <br>
 <br>
There's a rash forming<br>
on the back of your legs.    <br>
 <br>
What? There is?    <br>
 <br>
- (BACK CRACKS)<br>
- Ah! Son of a bitch!    <br>
 <br>
Lois, what the hell's going on with you?    <br>
 <br>
I don't know!    <br>
 <br>
I think seeing Stephanie brought back    <br>
 <br>
one of my old junior high school<br>
panic att*cks.    <br>
 <br>
(GASPING) Quick,<br>
I have to do the only thing    <br>
 <br>
that would calm me back then:    <br>
 <br>
lie in a dark room<br>
and try to blast Sarah McLachlan    <br>
 <br>
but accidentally play the wrong song.    <br>

Have we ever been alone<br>

 <br>
- So, Instagram update...<br>
- We're talking!    <br>
 <br>
The hacker contacted me.    <br>
 <br>
He's demanding $  ,   !    <br>
 <br>
I hear you're looking to k*ll somebody.    <br>
 <br>
What? No. I'm just trying to find a guy    <br>
 <br>
who hacked my Instagram account.    <br>
 <br>
I can also help with that.    <br>
 <br>
I'm really good at finding cyberbullies.    <br>
 <br>
One time, I got<br>
an anonymous tweet telling me    <br>
 <br>
to go k*ll myself and I tracked<br>
the IP address to...    <br>
 <br>
- Chrissy Teigen.<br>
- Chrissy Teigen?    <br>
 <br>
Yeah, that's... It's kind of her thing.    <br>
 <br>
- I don't know how you're gonna find...<br>
- That's in Russia.    <br>
 <br>
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)    <br>
 <br>
How do you know how to speak Russian?    <br>
 <br>
If you watch enough super dark<br>
videos on the Internet,    <br>
 <br>
eventually you're gonna learn Russian.    <br>
 <br>
First, just the Russian words<br>
for "please don't k*ll me,"    <br>
 <br>
but it's amazing how those<br>
are really the building blocks    <br>
 <br>
of an entire language.    <br>
 <br>
- German's very similar.<br>
- And then I was able to make    <br>
 <br>
some friends in a Russian AOL chat room.    <br>
 <br>
You've got a whole<br>
little life going on, huh?    <br>
 <br>
Can you figure out what city<br>
this hacker lives in?    <br>
 <br>
Okay, I'm thinking<br>
the big boys in Moscow    <br>
 <br>
are phishing in Europe.    <br>
 <br>
Russia has    time zones,<br>
so if we triangulate    <br>
 <br>
the activity through peak hours...    <br>
 <br>
Yup. Just what I thought.    <br>
 <br>
- Chelyabinsk.<br>
- That was fast.    <br>
 <br>
You got to move fast in this world, bro.    <br>
 <br>
So, are we gonna go<br>
find this guy or what?    <br>
 <br>
All right, looks like<br>
we're going to Russia.    <br>
 <br>
Russia? We can't go there.<br>
They're at w*r with Ukraine!    <br>
 <br>
- They are? Whoa, crazy.<br>
- I say we do it.    <br>
 <br>
We're really gonna go<br>
to a country at w*r,    <br>
 <br>
and we couldn't go to my<br>
business meeting on Fire Island?    <br>
 <br>
What business meeting?    <br>
 <br>
I sell bikini swimsuits<br>
for "men of size."    <br>
 <br>
- You mean fat guys?<br>
- No.    <br>
 <br>
(LAUGHS): No, no, no, no, no, no.    <br>
 <br>
Are you here<br>
for business or displeasure?    <br>
 <br>
We're here to find the hacker that...    <br>

I feel like I'm turning back<br>
into my old teenage self,    <br>
 <br>
and there's nothing I can do about it.    <br>
 <br>
I see. Did you recently<br>
run into an old bully    <br>
 <br>
or were you tagged<br>
in a very unflattering    <br>
 <br>
Throwback Thursday photo?    <br>
 <br>
I did. I ran into a girl who<br>

I just learned what that is<br>

Dr. Hartman, what's happening to me?    <br>
 <br>
Well, Mrs. Griffin,<br>
I think you're suffering    <br>
 <br>
from severe nerd damage.    <br>
 <br>
I am? What's that?    <br>
 <br>
You see, all nerds are<br>
one tossed-off joke away    <br>
 <br>
from reverting to their worst,<br>
most humiliating selves.    <br>
 <br>
But I don't want to be a nerd forever.    <br>
 <br>
Tell you what,<br>
find the coolest guy in school    <br>
 <br>
and give him a tug behind the bleachers.    <br>
 <br>
That usually solves it.    <br>
 <br>
Does that really work?    <br>
 <br>
I don't know.    <br>

Why don't we go find out.    <br>

Hey, you guys, this is exciting.    <br>
 <br>
I'm reading about Chelyabinsk,    <br>
 <br>
and if it's not too much trouble,    <br>
 <br>
I'd love to swing by<br>
Kuznetsov's tea-packing factory.    <br>
 <br>
It was built in         <br>
 <br>
and briefly popularized<br>
the phrase "Have a cup of Kuz."    <br>
 <br>
- Yeah, I don't know.<br>
- Oh, you're no fun.    <br>
 <br>
Meg? Cup of Kuz?    <br>

Come on, we got to find this guy.    <br>

Now, think like a hacker.<br>
Where would he be?    <br>

Why don't we just follow<br>
this giant ethernet cable?    <br>
 <br>
Did you know Chelyabinsk is known    <br>
 <br>
as "the Chicago of the Urals?"    <br>
 <br>
I'm-I'm, like, pinching myself,<br>
I'm that jazzed.    <br>
 <br>
Let me handle this.    <br>
 <br>
I sorry. I also conveniently<br>
speak a little English.    <br>

Come in, I explain over cup of Kuz.    <br>

Oh, jackpot! And you know<br>
they're gonna have good Kuz.    <br>

First, I must know,<br>
is it true in America    <br>

there's a man named<br>
Cedric who entertains?    <br>

- Wow.    <br>

So, Brian Griffin,<br>
is this beautiful American wife?    <br>
 <br>
Me? No, I'm not married.    <br>

You are like big beautiful nesting doll    <br>

Aw, Meg, you're pretty<br>
in this very ugly country.    <br>

Brian, I only stole account<br>
because it made me feel    <br>
 <br>
like I was living happy American<br>
life of big writer man.    <br>
 <br>
He has five followers.    <br>
 <br>
I have nobody and nothing to live for.    <br>
 <br>
Well, you have to have some family.    <br>
 <br>
No, they all burnt.    <br>
 <br>
At least you have a place to call home.    <br>
 <br>
Nyet. My apartment also burnt.<br>
This temporary.    <br>
 <br>
I lived in puddle for while<br>
but sun dried up my house.    <br>
 <br>
I yell at sun, "Give it back!"<br>
But it never does.    <br>
 <br>
That is why every day I wake up<br>
and sh**t single b*llet at sun.    <br>
 <br>
That would actually make<br>
a good Instagram.    <br>

Post that every day.    <br>

I was trying to catch a football<br>

I wasn't trying to complete the pass.    <br>

Sorry, I'm muling<br>
quite a bit of Kuz right now.    <br>

Where's your stuff?    <br>

Brian, we came here to find your account    <br>

my happiness.    <br>

Yeah, le-let me be the writer, Meg.    <br>

I can't go back home.    <br>

female body hair is encouraged,    <br>

you have strong haunches like horse."    <br>

I'm an eight in Russia, Brian.    <br>

I'm staying here.    <br>
 <br>
Well, okay.    <br>
 <br>
But we're truly gonna miss you.    <br>

And if this really is<br>
the end of our time together,    <br>
 <br>
we probably ought to tally up<br>
expenses from the trip.    <br>
 <br>
Oh, um, okay.    <br>
 <br>
Yeah, I bought that magazine<br>
at the airport,    <br>
 <br>
so let's put that in the "group" column.    <br>
 <br>
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.<br>
- Yeah, no,    <br>
 <br>
airport purchases,<br>
we said, were all together.    <br>
 <br>
You're the only one who read that.    <br>
 <br>
It goes in the "Brian" column.    <br>
 <br>
You read the cover. You commented on it.    <br>
 <br>
All I said was, "When did<br>
Miles Teller get so jacked?"    <br>
 <br>
- Yeah. That's reading.<br>
- That's not reading.    <br>
 <br>
That's just looking at a picture<br>
and commenting.    <br>
 <br>
So you're saying<br>
the words "Miles Teller"    <br>
 <br>
were not on the cover?    <br>
 <br>
Oh, okay, well,<br>
when I bought my Clif Bar,    <br>
 <br>
you said, "Mmm, peanut butter<br>
and chocolate, looks good."    <br>
 <br>
Sounds like a group expense to me.    <br>
 <br>
No way. Meg, wouldn't you<br>
call that a personal...    <br>
 <br>
- Uhp, she's gone.<br>
- Yep.    <br>

Guess we're covering<br>
her neck pillow, huh?    <br>
 <br>
Oh, g*ng, we got<br>
another postcard from Meg.    <br>
 <br>
"Dear Mom and Dad,    <br>
 <br>
"I've contracted rinderpest,    <br>
 <br>
"also known as cattle plague,    <br>

"which has been eradicated<br>
from most of the world,    <br>

"except from here.    <br>

Aw, I'm just glad she's having fun.    <br>
 <br>
Yeah, and thank God    <br>

everything worked out<br>
between me and Stephanie,    <br>
 <br>
so I can finally put all that<br>
middle school baggage behind me.    <br>
 <br>
And maybe I can start putting    <br>
 <br>
some of my other baggage behind me.    <br>
