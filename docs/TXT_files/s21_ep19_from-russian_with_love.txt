- Oh, they seem to be doing okay.    
  
Hey, can you guys keep it down? 
I'm about to go on IG Live.    
  
Like I said, "IG Live."    
  
All right, Meg's going 
for her phone. She...    
  
Uhp, no, she's just scratching herself.    
  
Well, uh, anyway, 
if-if you guys are gonna join,    
  
just go into another room, 
or I'll get interference.    
  
Other than that, uh...    
  
I don't know, just buckle up 
and enjoy the ride.    
  
Oh, and I tagged Kurt Vonnegut's nephew,    
  
so just... just be cool on there.    
  
Boy, he's sure living 
a lot longer than we expected.    
  
Going live in three, two, one.    
  
(HOWLS) What's up, IG Live?!    
  
It's Brian Griffin, and 
you are live in the "Dog House."    
  
Okay, no viewers yet. I'll do it again.    
  
Hopefully I can keep that energy.    
  
Uhp, got my first viewer.    
  
Whoa! Getting a little crowded in here.    
  
And @BuyCryptoKid   has 
left the building.    
  
All right, welcome @WinACarAskMeHow.    
  
And we got @LearnGuitarln Days 
on the line.    
  
Let's get started.    
  
What I'm sure is on both your minds is:    
  
what is the "hero's journey"?    
  
Well, that's a question pondered 
by writers for many, many...    
  
Welcome, @Gain Inchesln Week... 
Many years.    
  
Let me recap what we've learned so far.    
  
Writer, "hero's journey," 
many, many, many years.    
  
On the page that seemed 
like eight minutes of material.    
  
Should we bail him out with a question?    
  
No, we're not gonna 
bail him out with a question.    
  
We're gonna... You know what?    
  
I will ask him a question. 
Give me your phone.    
  
(NOTIFICATION POPS)    
  
(GASPS) We're gonna take a quick break.    
  
Hey, guys, I brought in your paper.    
  
Why do you get the newspaper 
if you're not gonna read it?    
  
Eh, sometimes I use it 
to punctuate my sentences.    
  
Well, anyway, I have a proposal 
for the two of you.    
  
Well, this ought to be interesting.    
  
Are the two of you free tonight 
for a double date?    
  
I'm seeing this girl, and 
I think she's something special.    
  
I want you to meet her.    
  
Oh, Glenn, that's wonderful.    
  
A-And you're sure she's not 
a sex worker this time?    
  
No, I-I'm pretty sure.    
  
I've offered her money many 
times, and she hasn't taken it.    
  
A double date sounds great. 
We'd love to go.    
  
(SINGSONGY): Ooh, 
the Quag's got a girlfriend.    
  
Ah! Get off me! We don't have 
that kind of relationship.    
  
Shoo! Go on, Meg! 
Get away from the house guest!    
  
Get away from the house guest!

- Whoa.    
  
A DM from @Officiallnstagram?    
  
"Hello, Brian.    
  
"As a famous writer, 
you are now eligible    
  
to become a verified account."    
  
Yes! Finally!    
  
Well, maybe next you can get 
a verified paycheck.    
  
Why is your paper 
called <em class="text-italics">Brazilian Teens?</em>    
  
Well, what's your paper of 
record for tan butts?    
  
Exactly.    
  
I can't wait to meet this 
new girlfriend of Quagmire's.    
  
You know, I always write 
their names down    
  
in case his life becomes a <em class="text-italics">Dateline.</em>    
  
(GASPS) Oh, my God! It's her!    
  
- What? It's who? 
- Quagmire's girlfriend is    
  
my old junior high school bully, 
Stephanie.    
  
She made my life a living hell.    
  
Oh, see, that guy's wearing sandals.    
  
I could've worn mine.    
  
Peter, you don't know this    
  
because you met me in high school,    
  
but middle school was a 
painfully awkward phase for me.    
  
(LIVELY CHATTER)    
  
<em class="text-italics">I had horrible acne, 
I had to wear a back brace,</em>    
  
<em class="text-italics">and to make things worse, only 
one of my boobs had come in.</em>    
  
<em class="text-italics">I had to resort to filling

(LAUGHTER)     
  
- Look, it's Scoli-Lois. 
- What a freak.     
  
I just ate a sandwich, so 
I'm waiting    minutes to swim.     
  
<em class="text-italics">LOIS: But the worst bully 
of them all was Stephanie.</em>     
  
Hey, Lois, watch your step.     
  
Your shoe's untied.     
  
(SCREAMS)     
  
(LAUGHTER)     
  
<em class="text-italics">LOIS: No one even tried to help.</em>     
  
- What a loser! 
- Walk much?     
  
   more minutes.     
  
<em class="text-italics">I would've drowned 
if it wasn't for the buoyancy</em>     
  
<em class="text-italics">of the Pop-O-Matic.</em>     
  
- (POPS) 
- (GASPING)     
  
Stephanie never even apologized, 
and junior high trauma     
  
is something you don't recover from.     
  
Yeah, my gym teacher drove me 
home without his pants on,     
  
but your story sounds bad, too.     
  
Well, looks like all that 
hard work is finally paying off.     
  
I got verified on Instagram.     
  
Look at that, a blue check.     
  
Blue check? That's green.     
  
Brian, you got hacked.     
  
That's ridiculous.     
  
Someone DM'd me and said     
  
they just needed 
my mother's maiden name,     
  
the last four numbers of my credit card,     
  
and the first    numbers 
of my credit card.     
  
Then they responded right away with,     
  
"Thank you, comploted."     
  
Huh.     
  
That's not how you spell "completed."     
  
- (PHONE RINGS) 
- It's my credit card company.     
  
Hello?     
  
No, that wasn't me.     
  
No. No. Ma'am, 
I wouldn't know what to do     
  
with that many Tommy Hilfiger T-shirts.     
  
- Yuck. 
- (PHONE BEEPS)     
  
Okay, you were right. I got hacked.     
  
I'm so mad, 
that hacker has me seeing gray.     
  
Red. It's red, Brian.     
  
Why are you so upset?     
  
You already canceled your credit card.     
  
This hacker is destroying my Instagram.     
  
I have a brand.     
  
Posting Steve Harvey stand-up jokes     
  
is actually Steve Harvey's brand.     
  
I think you should just 
give your account to the hacker.     
  
I mean, your Instagram wasn't 
setting the world on fire.     
  
And I suppose 
the hacker's posts are better?     
  
Look at this, it's just 
a half a bottle of vodka     
  
that says, <em class="text-italics">"Eto vodka-chas gde-to."</em>     
  
Brian, what does that even mean?     
  
Hit "See translation."     
  
"It's vodka o'clock somewhere."     
  
(LAUGHING): Oh, 
that's very funny. That's very funny.     
  
You know, I've heard 
it's "wine o'clock,"     
  
but I've never heard it with vodka.     
  
That's what... That's-that's 
whip smart is what that is.     
  
No! No, it's not!     
  
Stewie, I need to get my account back.     
  
I-I may have sent 
some weird DMs to Zendaya     
  
that I'd rather 
not see the light of day.     
  
Euphoria Zendaya or Disney Zendaya?     
  
Yeah, a little from column A, 
a little from column B.     
  
We need to get that account back.     
  
Lois Pewterschmidt, what a small world.     
  
Nice to see you, too.     
  
You have aged infuriatingly well.     
  
So, how did you two meet?     
  
Did you both escape 
from the same sex cult?     
  
Sex cults sound terrible,     
  
but also, how do I get invited to one?     
  
- You tell it. 
- No, you tell it.     
  
No, you just tell it.     
  
- No, you. Fine, I'll go. 
- No, you, you go.     
  
(BOTH LAUGHING)     
  
Okay, Tinder.     
  
Huh, didn't really need 
that whole parade.     
  
And how did you two meet?     
  
Lois was dating another guy, 
and I threatened to k*ll myself.     
  
Lois, remember you had that back brace     
  
everyone said made you look like 
an ironing board in a sweater?     
  
(GIGGLES) Say more stuff.     
  
You were a nerd? I thought 
you said you were a prom queen.     
  
Prawn Queen.     
  
She ate a lot of shellfish,     
  
and her back was curved liked a shrimp.     
  
(GIGGLES) I've never meant this before,     
  
but we should do this again.     
  
Kids were so mean back then.     
  
Well, I barely remember those years.     
  
Peter and I have three lovely kids.     
  
They're a lot happier since 
you're allowed to be fat now.     
  
Being a mom is the most 
fulfilling job in the world.     
  
Oh, do you have kids?     
  
Be careful how you answer this.     
  
Oh, I wish I did, 
but after medical school,     
  
then a four-year residency, 
a two-year specialty,     
  
three years in Central America 
with Doctors Without Borders...     
  
Okay. Well, I'm sure 
all those achievements     
  
will come visit you 
when you're on your death bed.     
  
Excuse me, some of 
the other diners have complained     
  
that you're not talking loudly enough.     
  
They're loving these stories 
about how she was a nerd.     
  
It was "prawn queen"! Like the shrimp!     
  
MAN: Oh, that's even funnier!     
  
(CHUCKLES) You know what?     
  
I feel sorry for Stephanie now.     
  
Really? What part? 
The good skin or the great job?     
  
Oh, pfft. "Great job."     
  
Anyone can be a doctor in Ecuador.     
  
You think they're checking diplomas?     
  
And she doesn't have any kids.     
  
Probably can't. You know why? GMOs.     
  
Just gonna run this light real quick.     
  
- (ENGINE REVS) 
- (HORN HONKS)     
  
Settle down.     
  
I mean, I ate way better 
than she was eating.     
  
Did you see I ordered a salad?     
  
It was a wedge that was mostly 
bleu cheese and bacon.     
  
It was listed under "salad."     
  
But did you notice Stephanie 
ordered french fries?     
  
French fries, no kids, you do the math.     
  
Anyway, point is, I won dinner.     
  
- (HORN HONKS) 
- Settle down.     
  
I mean, you-you think 
I won dinner, right, Peter?     
  
Well, you did eat a lot faster than her.     
  
And-and now that I think about it,     
  
after she said I looked "good," 
she looked right at my hands.     
  
What does that mean? Age comes 
out in the hands, Peter.     
  
Maybe she's trying to figure out 
how old I am!     
  
Well, but she knows how old I am.     
  
(GASPS) I bet she was judging 
my tiny wedding ring.     
  
Why was she looking at my hands, Peter?!     
  
I think your thumb was in the butter.     
  
But did she see that?     
  
I don't know, but 
nobody ate butter after that,     
  
so yeah, probably.     
  
I love that she had to ask 
what "caprese" was.     
  
What a dumb bitch.     
  
What-What's going on with your face?     
  
(LAUGHS): I don't know 
what you're talking about.     
  
Maybe-maybe it's a giant grin, huh?     
  
From having triumphed 
over my former bully!     
  
There's a rash forming 
on the back of your legs.     
  
What? There is?     
  
- (BACK CRACKS) 
- Ah! Son of a bitch!     
  
Lois, what the hell's going on with you?     
  
I don't know!     
  
I think seeing Stephanie brought back     
  
one of my old junior high school 
panic att*cks.     
  
(GASPING) Quick, 
I have to do the only thing     
  
that would calm me back then:     
  
lie in a dark room 
and try to blast Sarah McLachlan     
  
but accidentally play the wrong song.

- We're talking!     
  
The hacker contacted me.     
  
He's demanding $  ,   !     
  
I hear you're looking to k*ll somebody.     
  
What? No. I'm just trying to find a guy     
  
who hacked my Instagram account.     
  
I can also help with that.     
  
I'm really good at finding cyberbullies.     
  
One time, I got 
an anonymous tweet telling me     
  
to go k*ll myself and I tracked 
the IP address to...     
  
- Chrissy Teigen. 
- Chrissy Teigen?     
  
Yeah, that's... It's kind of her thing.     
  
- I don't know how you're gonna find... 
- That's in Russia.     
  
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)     
  
How do you know how to speak Russian?     
  
If you watch enough super dark 
videos on the Internet,     
  
eventually you're gonna learn Russian.     
  
First, just the Russian words 
for "please don't k*ll me,"     
  
but it's amazing how those 
are really the building blocks     
  
of an entire language.     
  
- German's very similar. 
- And then I was able to make     
  
some friends in a Russian AOL chat room.     
  
You've got a whole 
little life going on, huh?     
  
Can you figure out what city 
this hacker lives in?     
  
Okay, I'm thinking 
the big boys in Moscow     
  
are phishing in Europe.     
  
Russia has    time zones, 
so if we triangulate     
  
the activity through peak hours...     
  
Yup. Just what I thought.     
  
- Chelyabinsk. 
- That was fast.     
  
You got to move fast in this world, bro.     
  
So, are we gonna go 
find this guy or what?     
  
All right, looks like 
we're going to Russia.     
  
Russia? We can't go there. 
They're at w*r with Ukraine!     
  
- They are? Whoa, crazy. 
- I say we do it.     
  
We're really gonna go 
to a country at w*r,     
  
and we couldn't go to my 
business meeting on Fire Island?     
  
What business meeting?     
  
I sell bikini swimsuits 
for "men of size."     
  
- You mean fat guys? 
- No.     
  
(LAUGHS): No, no, no, no, no, no.     
  
Are you here 
for business or displeasure?     
  
We're here to find the hacker that...     
  
Stole your Instagram, yes.     
  
Enjoy ten-square kilometer of country     
  
that don't make Geiger counter 
go "beep, beep, beep."

- Hey!     
  
It's that way.     
  
And then Nurse Maguire 
gave everyone a valentine     
  
except for me.     
  
I want to be picked up now, Mom.     
  
Fine, I'll see you at  :  .     
  
- (PHONE BEEPS) 
- (SOBS)     
  
- What do you want? 
- Dr. Hartman,     
  
I have no idea what's going on.     
  
I feel like I'm turning back 
into my old teenage self,     
  
and there's nothing I can do about it.     
  
I see. Did you recently 
run into an old bully     
  
or were you tagged 
in a very unflattering     
  
Throwback Thursday photo?     
  
I did. I ran into a girl who 
terrorized me in junior high     
  
and she used to call me Scoli-Lois.     
  
(LAUGHS) Like "scoliosis." 
That's very good.     
  
I just learned what that is 
today, as a matter of fact.     
  
Dr. Hartman, what's happening to me?     
  
Well, Mrs. Griffin, 
I think you're suffering     
  
from severe nerd damage.     
  
I am? What's that?     
  
You see, all nerds are 
one tossed-off joke away     
  
from reverting to their worst, 
most humiliating selves.     
  
But I don't want to be a nerd forever.     
  
Tell you what, 
find the coolest guy in school     
  
and give him a tug behind the bleachers.     
  
That usually solves it.     
  
Does that really work?     
  
I don't know.     
  
Why don't we go find out.

Hey, you guys, this is exciting.     
  
I'm reading about Chelyabinsk,     
  
and if it's not too much trouble,     
  
I'd love to swing by 
Kuznetsov's tea-packing factory.     
  
It was built in          
  
and briefly popularized 
the phrase "Have a cup of Kuz."     
  
- Yeah, I don't know. 
- Oh, you're no fun.     
  
Meg? Cup of Kuz?

No, they all burnt.

But it never does.     
  
That is why every day I wake up 
and sh**t single b*llet at sun.     
  
That would actually make 
a good Instagram.     
  
Post that every day.     
  
What? It would.

I don't understand why 
the man who can't go swimming     
  
has a pool party.     
  
Once the harness is fixed, 
I can be lowered.     
  
Wasn't this a great idea of Stephanie's?     
  
After the dinner we had, 
she told me all about the fun     
  
you guys used to have at pool parties.     
  
Oh, okay, that's nice.     
  
Don't you think it's a little strange     
  
that Stephanie would want 
to have a pool party     
  
when that's the very place 
she humiliated me?     
  
I-I'm sorry, Lois. There's a guy 
here who's fatter than me,     
  
and I'm just checking out 
his front-meats.     
  
(SIGHS)     
  
Hey, Lois. You're not going in?     
  
No, I'm covered in Differin gel.     
  
I can't go in the chlorine or the sun.     
  
- (GRUNTS) 
- Oh, sorry, Lois.     
  
I thought you were the towel return bin.     
  
Well, if you need anything, 
I'll be over there     
  
playing generic backyard party 
football with your husband.     
  
I can play, too.     
  
(GRUNTS)     
  
As soon as I unclasp my hernia girdle.     
  
Aah!     
  
(GARGLING, GASPING)     
  
(COUGHING)     
  
You pushed me! She pushed me!     
  
Lois, let me help.     
  
Oh, you can drop the act, Stephanie.     
  
You may have won everyone over, 
but you're nothing more     
  
than a mean girl and a bully,     
  
just like you were in junior high.     
  
But karma comes in many forms, 
including stretch marks.     
  
- We all see them! 
- I don't see them.     
  
BOTH: Above the knee on her left thigh.     
  
You pushed me now,     
  
just like you pushed me 
back in junior high.     
  
Lois, I never pushed you.     
  
I was trying to help you.     
  
I was always trying to help you.     
  
Hey, Lois, watch your step!     
  
- Your shoe's untied. 
- Aah!     
  
And what about just now?     
  
You got an excuse for that?     
  
Well, yes.     
  
I was trying to catch a football 
thrown by your husband.     
  
I wasn't trying to complete the pass.     
  
I was just trying 
to show the other wives     
  
how far I can throw it.     
  
So, this whole time 
you never bullied me?     
  
No. I always admired how you persevered     
  
through all these burdens.     
  
In fact, you inspired me 
to start my own foundation     
  
for kids with scoliosis.     
  
This year, we have 
   Scoli-Lois scholars.     
  
- Fifty? 
- Yes, all in your honor.     
  
Oh, I'm sorry, Stephanie. 
I-I guess I was wrong.     
  
All right! That means it's 
your turn to service me in bed.     
  
No, Peter, that's only when I'm wrong     
  
about something having to do with you.     
  
Chris, don't let anyone touch my cake.     
  
I'll be back in ten minutes.     
  
Hi, Lois' friends!     
  
Well, you ready to head home, Stewie?     
  
What's that, Brian?     
  
Sorry, I'm muling 
quite a bit of Kuz right now.     
  
Where's your stuff?     
  
Brian, we came here to find your account     
  
but found something much more valuable:     
  
my happiness.     
  
Yeah, le-let me be the writer, Meg.     
  
I can't go back home.     
  
What? You're staying in Russia?     
  
This is a country where 
female body hair is encouraged,     
  
where I can eat root vegetables 
straight from the ground     
  
without being placed under 
an involuntary psychiatric hold.     
  
Last night, when Ivan made love to me...     
  
- Aah, no, no, no. 
- Uh, please, please stop.     
  
- Nope, nope, nope. 
- Stop, stop.     
  
He said, (RUSSIAN ACCENT): "Meg Griffin,     
  
you have strong haunches like horse."     
  
(REGULAR ACCENT): How sweet is that?     
  
I'm an eight in Russia, Brian.     
  
I'm staying here.     
  
Well, okay.     
  
But we're truly gonna miss you.     
  
And if this really is 
the end of our time together,     
  
we probably ought to tally up 
expenses from the trip.     
  
Oh, um, okay.     
  
Yeah, I bought that magazine 
at the airport,     
  
so let's put that in the "group" column.     
  
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on. 
- Yeah, no,     
  
airport purchases, 
we said, were all together.     
  
You're the only one who read that.     
  
It goes in the "Brian" column.     
  
You read the cover. You commented on it.     
  
All I said was, "When did 
Miles Teller get so jacked?"     
  
- Yeah. That's reading. 
- That's not reading.     
  
That's just looking at a picture 
and commenting.     
  
So you're saying 
the words "Miles Teller"     
  
were not on the cover?     
  
Oh, okay, well, 
when I bought my Clif Bar,     
  
you said, "Mmm, peanut butter 
and chocolate, looks good."     
  
Sounds like a group expense to me.     
  
No way. Meg, wouldn't you 
call that a personal...     
  
- Uhp, she's gone. 
- Yep.     
  
Guess we're covering 
her neck pillow, huh?     
  
Oh, g*ng, we got 
another postcard from Meg.     
  
"Dear Mom and Dad,     
  
"I've contracted rinderpest,     
  
"also known as cattle plague,     
  
"which has been eradicated 
from most of the world,     
  
"except from here.     
  
They say I'm a local now, ha-ha."     
  
Aw, I'm just glad she's having fun.     
  
Yeah, and thank God     
  
everything worked out 
between me and Stephanie,     
  
so I can finally put all that 
middle school baggage behind me.     
  
And maybe I can start putting     
  
some of my other baggage behind me.     
  
Peter, we need to talk.     
  
I think this relationship has...     
  
If you leave me I will k*ll myself.     
  
(SIGHS)     
  
I love us.</div>
