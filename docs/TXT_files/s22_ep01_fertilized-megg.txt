What are you up to there, Stewie?   <br>
 <br>
Big birthday party today,<br>
just finishing up my card.   <br>

"Happy birthday, Gurt"?   <br>
 <br>
Yeah, it's short for "yogurt."   <br>

I like the blue truck.   <br>

Thanks. It was supposed<br>
to be a fire engine,   <br>

but I couldn't find the red glitter pen.   <br>

Well, that's our<br>
long-form tax return done.   <br>

I could be wrong, but I think   <br>
 <br>
we're getting a million dollars back.   <br>
 <br>
Oh, I'm glad you're<br>
here. I ran out of bleach   <br>
 <br>
halfway through my<br>
mustache treatment today,   <br>
 <br>
so, Peter, I'm gonna<br>
need you to take Stewie   <br>

Hey, Meg, I'm gonna<br>
need you to take Stewie   <br>

 <br>
We sure raised a few<br>
fine delegates, huh?   <br>
 <br>
Peter, I don't think you<br>
learned the word "delegate."   <br>

I will not be delegated in my own house.   <br>

Meg for nine whole months.    <br>

That's honestly what you're<br>
taking away from all this?    <br>

Well, yeah. I'm still getting sush.    <br>

Anyone else for sush? Dad, sush?    <br>

Ma, sush? Chris, sush?    <br>
