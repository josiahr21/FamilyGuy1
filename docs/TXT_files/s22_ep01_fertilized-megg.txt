What are you up to there, Stewie?   
 
Big birthday party today,

"Happy birthday, Gurt"?

but I couldn't find the red glitter pen.   
 
Well, that's our
long-form tax return done.   
 
I could be wrong, but I think   
 
we're getting a million dollars back.   
 
Oh, I'm glad you're
here. I ran out of bleach   
 
halfway through my
mustache treatment today,   
 
so, Peter, I'm gonna
need you to take Stewie   
 
to the bowling alley for a party.   
 
Hey, Meg, I'm gonna
need you to take Stewie   
 
to the bowling alley for a party.   
 
I just learned the word "delegate."   
 
No skin off my sack. I
love the bowling alley.   
 
I'm coming, too.

machine with a bra in it.   
 
We sure raised a few
fine delegates, huh?   
 
Peter, I don't think you
learned the word "delegate."   
 
I will not be delegated in my own house.   
 
This is gonna be fun, Stewie.   
 
Yeah, I'm pumped.

All right, let's stick it to the British

Okay, you know what,

have breakfast, right?

- No, no, no. You throw that out,

How about this throat
coat with echinacea?   
 
Okay, you guys are gonna hate me,   
 
but we're coming up
on cold and flu season.

- No!
- That can't be the first time our baby hears ABBA.    
 
That's right. It should
be at a jockstrap foam rave    
 
in Miami Beach, same as me.    
 
What? Wait!    
 
But-but I'm the hot grandma!    
 
[GASPS] You're a grandma?    
 
You look amazing!    
 
Oh, you. Come on.    
 
Could a grandma wear
this to a spin class?    
 
I mean, yes, she could, because I did,    
 
so that happened.    
 
Thank you, Meg.
You've completed our family.    
 
We have our baby and we have you.    
 
Well, I guess that means    
 
I can get rid of all
my hot grandma merch.    
 
I'll just donate it to Goodwill.    
 
You know what "GILF" means, right?    
 
Yeah. "God, I love fentanyl."    
 
You said it, pal.    
 
Well, Bruce and Jeffrey, I got to say,    
 
you two have really stepped up    
 
to become a couple of great dads.    
 
Thank you, Lois.
You sound a bit surprised,    
 
which seems right for a
woman with that haircut,    
 
but you're sweet to say so.    
 
- [FUSSING]
- Uh-oh.    
 
Someone's being a little fussy britches.    
 
Oh, she's tired.    
 
You get the lights and
I'll sing her to sleep.

[FUSSING STOPS]    
 
Yeah, that seems about right
for a guy with that haircut.    
 
[QUIETLY] Thank you, Peter.</div
