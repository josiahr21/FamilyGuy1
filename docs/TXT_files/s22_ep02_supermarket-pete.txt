Boy, everybody's here. 
 
Why do you think we're gathering? 
 
This isn't about the soiled
pants in the toilet, right? 
 
'Cause I hadn't heard about that. 
 
Good morning, employees. 
 
As some of you can tell by my face, 
 
I have some exciting news. 
 
But first, a pair of husky-size
green pants were found 
 
in the men's room, positively destroyed. 
 
(WHISPERS): That's what
I hadn't heard about. 
 
Now the exciting news. 
 
The brewery is transitioning
to an open floor plan 
 
and will be called the
Pawtucket Patriot Campus. 
 
To help explain the transition
to our futuristic workplace, 
 
I'd like to share a
video from our investor, 
 
The confusingly
charismatic WeWork lunatic. 
 
<em class="text-italics">Hey, I'm the guy from WeWork. 
 
<em class="text-italics">My foremost goal is to facilitate 
 
<em class="text-italics">an experiential bandwidth of synergy. 
 
<em class="text-italics">Hammock desks, scooter desks, 
 
<em class="text-italics">and the world's first desk-desk. 
 
<em class="text-italics">The only desk that
functions as a working desk. 
 
<em class="text-italics">I have been the WeWork lunatic,
please don't google me. 
 
Our new office will also have 
 
a lady chef who only makes vegan food, 
 
pinball machines, and nursing pods. 
 
Lastly, as we transition
to our new open floor plan, 
 
the brewery will be closed for the
next two months for construction. 
 
- Yes, Griffin?
- Are the nursing pods, l-like, for anyone? 
 
If I ordered a whole Cornish game hen,
would anyone have any? 
 
I'm in for a wing. What's the occasion? 
 
I just found out the brewery's closing 
 
so they can turn it into
the kind of workplace 
 
you only see on TV shows. 
 
Work's been crazy for me, too. 
 
We have this case...
guy d*ed on his birthday, 
 
and... get this... his family had
gotten him an ice cream cake. 
 
You know, the kind with ice
cream inside as the cake part? 
 
(LAUGHS) 
 
Wild stuff. So I'm at the scene... 
 
This story is already too
complicated and boring. 
 
- Peter, take over.
- My Amazon guy once delivered batteries 
 
- to Pat Sajak.
- No way! 
 
How did he know there
were batteries in the box? 
 
You know, whenever they ship a battery, 
 
they got to put that little
warning label on the box? 
 
- That's how.
- It could've just been 
 
something with a battery in it. 
 
No, he said he shook it real hard. 
 
I-I think the focus of this story is 
 
more Pat Sajak than the battery part. 
 
Hold on. There's no way that
story was better than mine. 
 
Hey, Brian. What's all this? 
 
Oh, just following in the rich tradition 
 
of Hemingway and Faulkner 
 
and putting a little
damage on the old liver. 
 
Another rosé, Brian? 
 
Put a spritz on it. 
 
So, is, uh, watching
TikToks of underage girls 
 
also part of your writing process? 
 
The best writing happens when
you're not actually writing. 
 
I just wish my muse would speak to me. 
 
I'm having a tough time finding
an idea for my next novel. 
 
Well, I'd tell you about
one of my m*rder cases, 
 
but apparently I'm a bad storyteller. 
 
- m*rder case?
- Oh, yeah, we had one last year. 
 
All signs pointed to the husband. 
 
- What happened?
- It was the husband. 
 
You know, we have a whole
file of cases in quahog 
 
that would make great stories. 
 
A lot of m*rder*d women out there, Bri. 
 
Half of them named Britney,
half of them named Lacey. 
 
That's one piece of advice
I always give young parents: 
 
Don't name them Britney or Lacey. 
 
Yeah, sad stuff. 
 
You know, true crime is huge right now. 
 
You could be sitting on a gold mine. 
 
A gold mine, huh? 
 
And this whole day I thought
it was just a smushed dook. 
 
<em class="text-italics">ANNOUNCER (ON TV): We now
return to curb your enthusiasm, 
 
<em class="text-italics">where Jeff Garlin just

<em class="text-italics">So, I put on the shirt. 
 
<em class="text-italics">You put on the shirt! 
 
<em class="text-italics">I paid for it. 
 
<em class="text-italics">You paid for it! 
 
<em class="text-italics">I'm starting to think you're, uh, 
 
<em class="text-italics">the weakest link in the cast. 
 
<em class="text-italics">Easily the weakest link! 
 
Peter, the bank called
to say we're overdrawn, 
 
and the credit card
company sent us a letter 
 
that just says: "Bitch
better have my money." 
 
Visa sent that? 
 
God, they can do whatever
they want in Delaware. 
 
Thanks for nothing, Sleepy Joe. 
 
I wonder if this has anything
to do with me not getting paid 
 
during the brewery renovations. 
 
Wh-what do you mean "not getting paid"? 
 
Well, Preston said
we're all transitioning 
 
to being independent contractors. 
 
The downside is we're
losing our health insurance, 
 
but there's gonna be a pinball
machine in the break room. 
 
Peter, we can't afford to go two months 
 
without your paycheck. 
 
You're gonna have to find
a job in the meantime. 
 
Lois, don't worry.
I got it all figured out. 
 
(SHOES TAPPING) 
 
"Dear Mr. Griffin, we
regret to inform you 
 
that we cannot offer you a space." 
 
- (SHOES TAPPING)
- (SINGSONGY): Another big dance check in the mail. 
 
I was just five years away
from three figures a month. 
 
(SHOES TAPPING SLOWLY) 
 
Joe, this stuff is great. 
 
Yep, one man's m*rder*d, estranged wife 
 
is another man's treasure. 
 
Brian, I'm gonna have to ask
you to put down the severed limb. 
 
I brought this from home. 
 
Drop it. Drop it! 
 
Ah, damn it, you said "drop
it," so now I got to drop it. 
 
You know, we should team up
and write a true crime novel. 
 
You don't happen to have any cases 
 
featuring pretty blonde women, do you? 
 
No, those get solved pretty quickly. 
 
This victim was brunette
and a little heavy. 
 
Okay, getting warmer. 
 
We'll just change a few
key details so people care. 
 
Gutierrez? Nope, Gordon. 
 
m*rder*d on an Indian reservation? 
 
Let's try Beverly Hills. 
 
I'm thinking we go novel,
podcast, docuseries, 
 
then full-blown blockbuster. 
 
But we'd also be doing this
for the families, right? 
 
Is that a new streaming platform? 
 
- No, like, the families of the victims?
- Oh, right. Yeah, sure. 
 
In fact, we'll give them
a sliver of the proceeds. 
 
And I'll give the fictional version 
 
of their daughter bigger boobs. 
 
Like-like real heavy naturals. 
 
Oh, yeah, that sounds
like a good compromise. 
 
Your special cart, Mrs. G. 
 
Just gave the wheels
a fresh coat of WD-. 
 
Why, thank you, James. 
 
Oh, Roberto, if you
weren't missing half an arm, 
 
I'd definitely consider it. 
 
Oh, how's the s today, hmm? 
 
Oh, Mrs. Lois, very fresh. 
 
What's she talking about, Mommy? 
 
(LAUGHS) Kale, dear. 
 
It's insider speak for kale. 
 
That can't possibly be a thing. 
 
Let me just find someone to make sure. 
 
Oh, looks like someone got
pulled from the night shift 
 
'cause I've never seen this free sample. 
 
- Peter?!
<em class="text-italics">- MAN (OVER SPEAKERS): Ladies and gentlemen, 
 
<em class="text-italics">we have a plot twist on aisle four. 
 
<em class="text-italics">I'm the assistant manager who
thinks work should be fun, 
 
<em class="text-italics">and definitely not a corporate spy 
 
<em class="text-italics">here to keep unions from forming. 
 
<em class="text-italics">But now that we're talking about it, 
 
<em class="text-italics">can you imagine if you had a grievance 
 
<em class="text-italics">and couldn't talk to me directly? 
 
<em class="text-italics">Anyway, I'm Elliot, 
 
<em class="text-italics">and I'm paying close attention 
 
<em class="text-italics">to who posts what on the
break room cork board. 
 
Peter, what are you doing here? 
 
You told me to get a
job, and they were hiring. 
 
I love it here! Plus,
they let me joke around 
 
with the Wells Fargo guys who work here. 
 
Yes, I'd like to make a deposit, please. 
 
Is it another  grand chocolate bar? 
 
Okay, so I've had you before. 
 
Peter, the grocery store
is kind of my domain. 
 
While I'm glad you got a job,
I don't love that you got one here. 
 
Don't worry. You won't
even know I'm here. 
 
Unless you're near the front door, 
 
which I can open with the force. 
 
Excuse me, where are the peanuts? 
 
Aisle seven. 
 
Peter, peanuts are on aisle two. 
 
Eh, I just tell 'em whatever number, 
 
and then I disappear
into the produce mist. 
 
Peter? Peter? 
 
PETER (ECHOING): There was
never Peter, only loose carrots. 
 
The body was discovered around : p.M. 
 
Unfortunately, I couldn't
make it down to the crime scene 
 
because there were no ramps. 
 
Okay, I'm gonna write: 
 
"Tonight, all the streets in
this town were a dead end." 
 
I never saw the body. 
 
It was cold, so they
sent me on a coffee run. 
 
My lap can accommodate two trays, 
 
and I can't feel the spills. 
 
"She was found in a creek,
her bosoms frozen solid." 
 
She was a heavyset -something
in welder's coveralls. 
 
"No one from Beverly Hills
had ever been strangled 
 
by their own cheerleader skirt before." 
 
(GASPS) 
 
Wow, I can't believe I'm
seeing how the sausage is made. 
 
Hey, so when you open a book
and you see "random house," 
 
is that something we come up with? 
 
Uh, no, that's-that's
the publisher's name. 
 
I see. Just drinking it all in. 
 
And what about the list of
cities you see under that name? 
 
Because I was thinking we should
put New York, Paris, Kokomo. 
 
Those are just the cities
where the publisher has offices. 
 
And Kokomo isn't a real city, Joe. 
 
Try telling the beach boys that. 
 
I don't know what our title
should be yet, but beneath it, 
 
it should say: "Soon to
be a major motion picture." 
 
I always buy the book when I see that. 
 
Why don't we just focus on the writing? 
 
Oh, hey, you ever see books
where the edges of the pages are gold? 
 
- Yeah?
- So cool. 
 
What is going on in here? 
 
Who put price tags on all the cans? 
 
And why is everything labeled  cents? 
 
<em class="text-italics">PETER (MUFFLED): Griffin family

Ma'am, don't worry, this
happens all the time. 
 
I'm sure you have your receipt. 
 
What? No, I don't have a receipt. 
 
Okay, then, we're just
gonna go to the office, 
 
call your parents, and
send you on your way. 
 
- Daddy, I just...
- There are gonna be some changes around here. 
 
First off, no more lipstick. 
 
That's how all this trouble started. 
 
Okay, so we just need the ending.
Who was the m*rder*r? 
 
Oh, I have no idea. It's a cold case. 
 
That's what makes 'em cold...
no one knows how to solve 'em. 
 
Well, how do we finish our novel 
 
if we don't know what
happened in real life? 
 
- Ghost cop.
- No. 
 
Do you know what this means? 
 
We're gonna put on our
Sherlock Holmes hats 
 
and solve the m*rder ourselves? 
 
Deerstalker hats, Joe. But yes. 
 
Stupid nonwriter! 
 
Okay, Brian, now, when you're visiting 
 
the family of a deceased victim, 
 
you need to hold a hat over your chest. 
 
It shows you care. 
 
All I have is this crown
from our burger king lunch. 
 
Hat's a hat. 
 
How can I help you,
Officer and Your Highness? 
 
Hi, yes. We're here with many
questions about your daughter. 
 
You know, the dead one?
You-you remember her? 
 
- We'd love any details.
- Is this some sort of sick joke? 
 
I assure you it's not, Ma'am. 
 
We're writing a future hit novel 
 
based on your daughter's m*rder. 
 
We just need to know who did it. 
 
And, between us, it'd be
great if one of you did. 
 
What is this? What do you want? 
 
Did you know Jonbenét Ramsey's dad 
 
dated Natalee Holloway's mom? 
 
What does that have to do with our case? 
 
Well, nothing, it's just
kind of weird, right? 
 
Do you happen to have
any grainy video footage 
 
of her singing an emotional
song at a talent show? 
 
Maybe Green Day's "Time of Your Life"? 
 
That would really bust this
project wide open for us. 
 
You're both unwell. 
 
Well, that was a bust. 
 
Sorry, I've been holding
this in since burger king. 
 
Oh, seriously? You're just
gonna leave that there? 
 
These people have
suffered a terrible loss. 
 
At least cover it with
leaves or something. 
 
Ugh, fine. 
 
Joe, look. I found something. 
 
- It's a key to a storage unit.
- How do you know that? 
 
Yeah, me and Bonnie have been
doing a fun role-play thing 
 
where she dresses up like a sexy maid 
 
and then locks me in a storage
unit while guys come over. 
 
- Oh.
- Yeah, it's pretty kinky. 
 
I, uh, I play the
role of a sexy armoire, 
 
waiting in another room. 
 
Sounds like she just wants you
out of the house for a while. 
 
Nah. No. 
 
It's okay, Lois. It's a big store. 
 
You may not even run into Peter. 
 
Good morning. How much are the mussels? 
 
$ a month at Bally's Total Fitness.

- Peter? Why are you behind the fish counter? 
 
I got a promotion,
emphasis on the "otion." 
 
- (BELL CHIMES)
- Fine. 
 
What do you got that's fresh? 
 
Well, I got a teenage son at home. 
 
- What a mouth on that kid.
- (BELL CHIMES) 
 
That's it! You have
ruined groceries for me! 
 
Get the hell out of
my store, you imbecile! 
 
Um, excuse me, miss, did you
just yell at this employee? 
 
You're damn right I did. 
 
He has no business being here. 
 
This man is a member of
the Stop 'n Shop family. 
 
He has every business being here. 
 
You, on the other hand, will have to go. 
 
You're banned from the store. 
 
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY): What? No. 
 
Y-you can't do this. 
 
I have shopped here my whole life. 
 
Yes, we know. If it's any consolation, 
 
you'll be in the "In Memoriam"
