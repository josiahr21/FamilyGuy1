 <br>
Boy, everybody's here. <br>
 <br>
Why do you think we're gathering? <br>
 <br>
This isn't about the soiled<br>
pants in the toilet, right? <br>
 <br>
'Cause I hadn't heard about that. <br>
 <br>
Good morning, employees. <br>
 <br>
As some of you can tell by my face, <br>
 <br>
I have some exciting news. <br>
 <br>
But first, a pair of husky-size<br>
green pants were found <br>
 <br>
in the men's room, positively destroyed. <br>
 <br>
(WHISPERS): That's what<br>
I hadn't heard about. <br>
 <br>
Now the exciting news. <br>
 <br>
The brewery is transitioning<br>
to an open floor plan <br>
 <br>
and will be called the<br>
Pawtucket Patriot Campus. <br>
 <br>
To help explain the transition<br>
to our futuristic workplace, <br>
 <br>
I'd like to share a<br>
video from our investor, <br>
 <br>
The confusingly<br>
charismatic WeWork lunatic. <br>
 <br>
<em class="text-italics">Hey, I'm the guy from WeWork.</em> <br>
 <br>
<em class="text-italics">My foremost goal is to facilitate</em> <br>
 <br>
<em class="text-italics">an experiential bandwidth of synergy.</em> <br>
 <br>
<em class="text-italics">Hammock desks, scooter desks,</em> <br>
 <br>
<em class="text-italics">and the world's first desk-desk.</em> <br>
 <br>
<em class="text-italics">The only desk that<br>
functions as a working desk.</em> <br>
 <br>
<em class="text-italics">I have been the WeWork lunatic,<br>
please don't google me.</em> <br>
 <br>
Our new office will also have <br>
 <br>
a lady chef who only makes vegan food, <br>
 <br>
pinball machines, and nursing pods. <br>
 <br>
Lastly, as we transition<br>
to our new open floor plan, <br>
 <br>
the brewery will be closed for the<br>
next two months for construction. <br>
 <br>
- Yes, Griffin?<br>
- Are the nursing pods, l-like, for anyone? <br>
 <br>
If I ordered a whole Cornish game hen,<br>
would anyone have any? <br>
 <br>
I'm in for a wing. What's the occasion? <br>
 <br>
I just found out the brewery's closing <br>
 <br>
so they can turn it into<br>
the kind of workplace <br>
 <br>
you only see on TV shows. <br>
 <br>
Work's been crazy for me, too. <br>
 <br>
We have this case...<br>
guy d*ed on his birthday, <br>
 <br>
and... get this... his family had<br>
gotten him an ice cream cake. <br>
 <br>
You know, the kind with ice<br>
cream inside as the cake part? <br>
 <br>
(LAUGHS) <br>
 <br>
Wild stuff. So I'm at the scene... <br>
 <br>
This story is already too<br>
complicated and boring. <br>
 <br>
- Peter, take over.<br>
- My Amazon guy once delivered batteries <br>
 <br>
- to Pat Sajak.<br>
- No way! <br>
 <br>
How did he know there<br>
were batteries in the box? <br>
 <br>
You know, whenever they ship a battery, <br>
 <br>
they got to put that little<br>
warning label on the box? <br>
 <br>
- That's how.<br>
- It could've just been <br>
 <br>
something with a battery in it. <br>
 <br>
No, he said he shook it real hard. <br>
 <br>
I-I think the focus of this story is <br>
 <br>
more Pat Sajak than the battery part. <br>
 <br>
Hold on. There's no way that<br>
story was better than mine. <br>
 <br>
Hey, Brian. What's all this? <br>
 <br>
Oh, just following in the rich tradition <br>
 <br>
of Hemingway and Faulkner <br>
 <br>
and putting a little<br>
damage on the old liver. <br>
 <br>
Another rosé, Brian? <br>
 <br>
Put a spritz on it. <br>
 <br>
So, is, uh, watching<br>
TikToks of underage girls <br>
 <br>
also part of your writing process? <br>
 <br>
The best writing happens when<br>
you're not actually writing. <br>
 <br>
I just wish my muse would speak to me. <br>
 <br>
I'm having a tough time finding<br>
an idea for my next novel. <br>
 <br>
Well, I'd tell you about<br>
one of my m*rder cases, <br>
 <br>
but apparently I'm a bad storyteller. <br>
 <br>
- m*rder case?<br>
- Oh, yeah, we had one last year. <br>
 <br>
All signs pointed to the husband. <br>
 <br>
- What happened?<br>
- It was the husband. <br>
 <br>
You know, we have a whole<br>
file of cases in quahog <br>
 <br>
that would make great stories. <br>
 <br>
A lot of m*rder*d women out there, Bri. <br>
 <br>
Half of them named Britney,<br>
half of them named Lacey. <br>
 <br>
That's one piece of advice<br>
I always give young parents: <br>
 <br>
Don't name them Britney or Lacey. <br>
 <br>
Yeah, sad stuff. <br>
 <br>
You know, true crime is huge right now. <br>
 <br>
You could be sitting on a gold mine. <br>
 <br>
A gold mine, huh? <br>
 <br>
And this whole day I thought<br>
it was just a smushed dook. <br>
 <br>
<em class="text-italics">ANNOUNCER (ON TV): We now<br>
return to curb your enthusiasm,</em> <br>
 <br>
<em class="text-italics">where Jeff Garlin just<br>

<em class="text-italics">So, I put on the shirt.</em> <br>
 <br>
<em class="text-italics">You put on the shirt!</em> <br>
 <br>

 <br>
<em class="text-italics">You paid for it!</em> <br>

<em class="text-italics">I'm starting to think you're, uh,</em> <br>
 <br>
<em class="text-italics">the weakest link in the cast.</em> <br>
 <br>
<em class="text-italics">Easily the weakest link!</em> <br>
 <br>
Peter, the bank called<br>
to say we're overdrawn, <br>
 <br>
and the credit card<br>
company sent us a letter <br>
 <br>
that just says: "Bitch<br>
better have my money." <br>
 <br>
Visa sent that? <br>
 <br>
God, they can do whatever<br>
they want in Delaware. <br>
 <br>
Thanks for nothing, Sleepy Joe. <br>
 <br>
I wonder if this has anything<br>
to do with me not getting paid <br>
 <br>
during the brewery renovations. <br>
 <br>
Wh-what do you mean "not getting paid"? <br>
 <br>
Well, Preston said<br>
we're all transitioning <br>
 <br>
to being independent contractors. <br>
 <br>
The downside is we're<br>
losing our health insurance, <br>
 <br>
but there's gonna be a pinball<br>
machine in the break room. <br>
 <br>
Peter, we can't afford to go two months <br>
 <br>
without your paycheck. <br>
 <br>
You're gonna have to find<br>
a job in the meantime. <br>
 <br>
Lois, don't worry.<br>
I got it all figured out. <br>
 <br>
(SHOES TAPPING) <br>
 <br>
"Dear Mr. Griffin, we<br>
regret to inform you <br>
 <br>
that we cannot offer you a space." <br>
 <br>
- (SHOES TAPPING)<br>
- (SINGSONGY): Another big dance check in the mail. <br>
 <br>
I was just five years away<br>
from three figures a month. <br>
 <br>
(SHOES TAPPING SLOWLY) <br>
 <br>
Joe, this stuff is great. <br>
 <br>
Yep, one man's m*rder*d, estranged wife <br>
 <br>
is another man's treasure. <br>
 <br>
Brian, I'm gonna have to ask<br>
you to put down the severed limb. <br>
 <br>
I brought this from home. <br>
 <br>
Drop it. Drop it! <br>
 <br>
Ah, damn it, you said "drop<br>
it," so now I got to drop it. <br>
 <br>
You know, we should team up<br>
and write a true crime novel. <br>
 <br>
You don't happen to have any cases <br>
 <br>
featuring pretty blonde women, do you? <br>
 <br>
No, those get solved pretty quickly. <br>
 <br>
This victim was brunette<br>
and a little heavy. <br>
 <br>
Okay, getting warmer. <br>
 <br>
We'll just change a few<br>
key details so people care. <br>
 <br>
Gutierrez? Nope, Gordon. <br>
 <br>
m*rder*d on an Indian reservation? <br>
 <br>
Let's try Beverly Hills. <br>
 <br>
I'm thinking we go novel,<br>
podcast, docuseries, <br>
 <br>
then full-blown blockbuster. <br>
 <br>
But we'd also be doing this<br>
for the families, right? <br>
 <br>
Is that a new streaming platform? <br>
 <br>
- No, like, the families of the victims?<br>
- Oh, right. Yeah, sure. <br>
 <br>
In fact, we'll give them<br>
a sliver of the proceeds. <br>
 <br>
And I'll give the fictional version <br>
 <br>
of their daughter bigger boobs. <br>
 <br>
Like-like real heavy naturals. <br>
 <br>
Oh, yeah, that sounds<br>
like a good compromise. <br>
 <br>
Your special cart, Mrs. G. <br>
 <br>
Just gave the wheels<br>
a fresh coat of WD-. <br>
 <br>
Why, thank you, James. <br>
 <br>
Oh, Roberto, if you<br>
weren't missing half an arm, <br>
 <br>
I'd definitely consider it. <br>
 <br>
Oh, how's the s today, hmm? <br>
 <br>
Oh, Mrs. Lois, very fresh. <br>
 <br>
What's she talking about, Mommy? <br>
 <br>
(LAUGHS) Kale, dear. <br>
 <br>
It's insider speak for kale. <br>
 <br>
That can't possibly be a thing. <br>
 <br>
Let me just find someone to make sure. <br>
 <br>
Oh, looks like someone got<br>
pulled from the night shift <br>
 <br>
'cause I've never seen this free sample. <br>
 <br>
- Peter?!<br>

 <br>
Peter, what are you doing here? <br>
 <br>
You told me to get a<br>
job, and they were hiring. <br>
 <br>
I love it here! Plus,<br>
they let me joke around <br>
 <br>
with the Wells Fargo guys who work here. <br>
 <br>
Yes, I'd like to make a deposit, please. <br>
 <br>
Is it another  grand chocolate bar? <br>
 <br>
Okay, so I've had you before. <br>
 <br>
Peter, the grocery store<br>
is kind of my domain. <br>
 <br>
While I'm glad you got a job,<br>
I don't love that you got one here. <br>
 <br>
Don't worry. You won't<br>
even know I'm here. <br>
 <br>
Unless you're near the front door, <br>
 <br>
which I can open with the force. <br>
 <br>
Excuse me, where are the peanuts? <br>
 <br>
Aisle seven. <br>
 <br>
Peter, peanuts are on aisle two. <br>
 <br>
Eh, I just tell 'em whatever number, <br>
 <br>
and then I disappear<br>
into the produce mist. <br>
 <br>
Peter? Peter? <br>
 <br>
PETER (ECHOING): There was<br>
never Peter, only loose carrots. <br>
 <br>
The body was discovered around : p.M. <br>
 <br>
Unfortunately, I couldn't<br>
make it down to the crime scene <br>
 <br>
because there were no ramps. <br>
 <br>
Okay, I'm gonna write: <br>
 <br>
"Tonight, all the streets in<br>
this town were a dead end." <br>
 <br>
I never saw the body. <br>
 <br>
It was cold, so they<br>
sent me on a coffee run. <br>
 <br>
My lap can accommodate two trays, <br>
 <br>
and I can't feel the spills. <br>
 <br>
"She was found in a creek,<br>
her bosoms frozen solid." <br>
 <br>
She was a heavyset -something<br>

"No one from Beverly Hills<br>
had ever been strangled <br>
 <br>
by their own cheerleader skirt before." <br>
 <br>
(GASPS) <br>
 <br>
Wow, I can't believe I'm<br>
seeing how the sausage is made. <br>
 <br>
Hey, so when you open a book<br>
and you see "random house," <br>
 <br>
is that something we come up with? <br>
 <br>
Uh, no, that's-that's<br>
the publisher's name. <br>
 <br>
I see. Just drinking it all in. <br>
 <br>
And what about the list of<br>
cities you see under that name? <br>
 <br>
Because I was thinking we should<br>
put New York, Paris, Kokomo. <br>
 <br>
Those are just the cities<br>
where the publisher has offices. <br>
 <br>
And Kokomo isn't a real city, Joe. <br>
 <br>
Try telling the beach boys that. <br>
 <br>
I don't know what our title<br>
should be yet, but beneath it, <br>
 <br>
it should say: "Soon to<br>
be a major motion picture." <br>
 <br>
I always buy the book when I see that. <br>
 <br>
Why don't we just focus on the writing? <br>
 <br>
Oh, hey, you ever see books<br>
where the edges of the pages are gold? <br>
 <br>
- Yeah?<br>
- So cool. <br>
 <br>
What is going on in here? <br>
 <br>
Who put price tags on all the cans? <br>
 <br>
And why is everything labeled  cents? <br>

 <br>
Ma'am, don't worry, this<br>
happens all the time. <br>
 <br>
I'm sure you have your receipt. <br>
 <br>
What? No, I don't have a receipt. <br>
 <br>
Okay, then, we're just<br>
gonna go to the office, <br>
 <br>
call your parents, and<br>
send you on your way. <br>
 <br>
- Daddy, I just...<br>
- There are gonna be some changes around here. <br>
 <br>
First off, no more lipstick. <br>
 <br>
That's how all this trouble started. <br>
 <br>
Okay, so we just need the ending.<br>
Who was the m*rder*r? <br>
 <br>
Oh, I have no idea. It's a cold case. <br>
 <br>
That's what makes 'em cold...<br>
no one knows how to solve 'em. <br>
 <br>
Well, how do we finish our novel <br>
 <br>
if we don't know what<br>
happened in real life? <br>
 <br>
- Ghost cop.<br>
- No. <br>
 <br>
Do you know what this means? <br>
 <br>
We're gonna put on our<br>
Sherlock Holmes hats <br>
 <br>
and solve the m*rder ourselves? <br>
 <br>
Deerstalker hats, Joe. But yes. <br>
 <br>
Stupid nonwriter! <br>
 <br>
Okay, Brian, now, when you're visiting <br>
 <br>
the family of a deceased victim, <br>
 <br>
you need to hold a hat over your chest. <br>
 <br>
It shows you care. <br>
 <br>
All I have is this crown<br>
from our burger king lunch. <br>
 <br>
Hat's a hat. <br>
 <br>
How can I help you,<br>
Officer and Your Highness? <br>
 <br>
Hi, yes. We're here with many<br>
questions about your daughter. <br>
 <br>
You know, the dead one?<br>
You-you remember her? <br>
 <br>
- We'd love any details.<br>
- Is this some sort of sick joke? <br>
 <br>
I assure you it's not, Ma'am. <br>
 <br>
We're writing a future hit novel <br>
 <br>
based on your daughter's m*rder. <br>
 <br>
We just need to know who did it. <br>
 <br>
And, between us, it'd be<br>
great if one of you did. <br>
 <br>
What is this? What do you want? <br>
 <br>
Did you know Jonbenét Ramsey's dad <br>
 <br>
dated Natalee Holloway's mom? <br>
 <br>
What does that have to do with our case? <br>
 <br>
Well, nothing, it's just<br>
kind of weird, right? <br>
 <br>
Do you happen to have<br>
any grainy video footage <br>
 <br>
of her singing an emotional<br>
song at a talent show? <br>
 <br>
Maybe Green Day's "Time of Your Life"? <br>
 <br>
That would really bust this<br>
project wide open for us. <br>
 <br>
You're both unwell. <br>
 <br>
Well, that was a bust. <br>
 <br>
Sorry, I've been holding<br>
this in since burger king. <br>
 <br>
Oh, seriously? You're just<br>
gonna leave that there? <br>
 <br>
These people have<br>
suffered a terrible loss. <br>
 <br>
At least cover it with<br>
leaves or something. <br>
 <br>
Ugh, fine. <br>
 <br>
Joe, look. I found something. <br>
 <br>
- It's a key to a storage unit.<br>
- How do you know that? <br>
 <br>
Yeah, me and Bonnie have been<br>
doing a fun role-play thing <br>
 <br>
where she dresses up like a sexy maid <br>
 <br>
and then locks me in a storage<br>
unit while guys come over. <br>
 <br>
- Oh.<br>
- Yeah, it's pretty kinky. <br>
 <br>
I, uh, I play the<br>
role of a sexy armoire, <br>
 <br>
waiting in another room. <br>
 <br>
Sounds like she just wants you<br>
out of the house for a while. <br>
 <br>
Nah. No. <br>
 <br>
It's okay, Lois. It's a big store. <br>
 <br>
You may not even run into Peter. <br>
 <br>
Good morning. How much are the mussels? <br>
 <br>
$ a month at Bally's Total Fitness. <br>
 <br>
- (BELL CHIMES)<br>
- Peter? Why are you behind the fish counter? <br>
 <br>
I got a promotion,<br>
emphasis on the "otion." <br>
 <br>
- (BELL CHIMES)<br>
- Fine. <br>
 <br>
What do you got that's fresh? <br>
 <br>
Well, I got a teenage son at home. <br>
 <br>
- What a mouth on that kid.<br>
- (BELL CHIMES) <br>
 <br>
That's it! You have<br>
ruined groceries for me! <br>
 <br>
Get the hell out of<br>
my store, you imbecile! <br>
 <br>
Um, excuse me, miss, did you<br>
just yell at this employee? <br>
 <br>
You're damn right I did. <br>
 <br>
He has no business being here. <br>
 <br>
This man is a member of<br>
the Stop 'n Shop family. <br>
 <br>
He has every business being here. <br>
 <br>
You, on the other hand, will have to go. <br>
 <br>
You're banned from the store. <br>
 <br>
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY): What? No. <br>
 <br>
Y-you can't do this. <br>
 <br>
I have shopped here my whole life. <br>
 <br>
Yes, we know. If it's any consolation, <br>
 <br>
you'll be in the "In Memoriam"<br>
section of the grocery store Oscars. <br>

seen Peter, have you? <br>
 <br>
Asking as a waitress<br>
trying to teach him a lesson <br>
 <br>
by working at his favorite<br>
place, not as his wife. <br>
 <br>
Whoa, check out the<br>
turd-cutter on the new chick. <br>
 <br>
That's right. I work here now. <br>
 <br>
I'm gonna be here all the time. <br>
 <br>
Oh, how does it feel to have<br>
someone inv*de your special space? <br>
 <br>
It feels great! <br>
 <br>
Speaking of invading special places, <br>
 <br>
how about this? <br>
 <br>
Hey, sweetie, when do you get off work? <br>
 <br>
Me and my wife are more friends<br>
at this point than anything. <br>
 <br>
Don't get me wrong, she's a great gal, <br>
 <br>
raised my children,<br>
but time takes its toll, <br>
 <br>
you know what I mean? <br>
 <br>
What? My wife and I have an arrangement, <br>
 <br>
so I'm not doing anything<br>
wrong here, technically. <br>
 <br>
Ah, well, this isn't working. <br>
 <br>
If you want to meet me in my car later, <br>
 <br>
it's the one with the<br>
"Blue Lives Matter" sticker. <br>
 <br>
But, like, not for cops,<br>
it's for, it's for Grover. <br>
 <br>
Who's going in first? <br>
 <br>
Kind of feels like you<br>
should since you're a dog. <br>
 <br>
Are you scared, Joe? <br>
 <br>
Would a scared person do this? <br>

 <br>

- I'm guessing it's the lady from <em class="text-italics">Serial</em>. <br>
 <br>
Oh, I certainly wouldn't<br>
recognize a podcaster visually. <br>
 <br>
- I'm Sarah Koenig.<br>

 <br>
No one turns another person's<br>
suffering into profit better. <br>
 <br>
Listen up, I want this<br>
case for my podcast, <br>
 <br>
so you need to drop it. <br>
 <br>
And if you don't, I<br>
could make you disappear. <br>

That wasn't a thr*at.<br>
I have a code if you want it. <br>

MAN: Stand down, Sarah. <br>
 <br>
I'm Keith Morrison, <br>
 <br>
and I want this case for <em class="text-italics">Dateline</em>. <br>
 <br>
There are only a few hundred<br>
unsolved murders left, <br>
 <br>
and there's a million true<br>
crime content creators. <br>
 <br>
My grandson taught me that term. <br>
 <br>
Who's "okay, boomer" now? <br>
 <br>
We're NPR's team of women with lisps <br>
 <br>
and names nobody's ever had, <br>
 <br>
like Sylvia Delgado-Smith,<br>
and Audie Takahashi O'shea. <br>
 <br>
I'm Chris Hansen from<br>
<em class="text-italics">To Catch a Predator</em>, <br>
 <br>
and I'm just here in case any of you <br>
 <br>
turn out to be pedophiles. <br>
 <br>
Warm chocolate chip cookie, anyone? <br>
 <br>
No! I claimed this cold case for <em class="text-italics">Serial</em>. <br>
 <br>
Not if I record a <em class="text-italics">Dateline</em> first. <br>

The sleepy little town of Quahog <br>

You know what? We're<br>
no better than them. <br>

We've been exploiting the victim's life <br>

 <br>
I-I think it's time for us<br>
to abandon writing this book. <br>
 <br>
Or... maybe we set it to rap<br>
lyrics and take it to Broadway? <br>
 <br>
I think we're done here. <br>

You know, Joe, even<br>
though it didn't work out, <br>

it was nice to spend<br>
some time with someone <br>

 <br>
Well, as someone who's never<br>

The waitress from the Clam!<br>
Holy crap, has Lois seen you?! <br>
 <br>
We really don't have an arrangement.<br>
You got to get out of here! <br>
 <br>
Oh, Peter, enough. <br>
 <br>
- What's the matter?<br>
- You wouldn't understand. <br>
 <br>
Okay. <br>
 <br>
I'd get back in there, Chief. <br>
 <br>
(SIGHS) Chris made me come back. <br>
 <br>
Oh, honey, the grocery store isn't just <br>
 <br>
where I buy food for the family. <br>
 <br>
It's my escape. <br>
 <br>
My refuge from being pestered <br>
 <br>
with dumb questions from the kids, <br>
 <br>
or having to clean up your messes. <br>
 <br>
Sometimes, just a stroll<br>
down the ethnic food aisle <br>
 <br>
makes me feel like I'm<br>
in a North African bazaar. <br>
 <br>
Yeah, I don't like the<br>
smells on that aisle. <br>
 <br>
- And I don't know, it's hard to explain, but...<br>
- There's more?! <br>
 <br>
It's not just a grocery store to me. <br>
 <br>
There's a whole community of<br>
people there who feel like family. <br>
 <br>
And now, now I have nothing. <br>
 <br>
Aw, Lois, I'm so sorry for<br>
ruining your happy place. <br>
 <br>
And I'm gonna take care of it. <br>
 <br>
Just like I've been taking care<br>
of that egg since high school. <br>
 <br>
Oh, my God, I forgot to pick<br>
him up from soccer practice! <br>
 <br>
Hey, do you need me to call your yolks? <br>
 <br>
Look, you got to let Lois come back. <br>
 <br>
Please remove the ban.<br>
She loves this place. <br>
 <br>
I'm sorry, but I can't do that. <br>
 <br>
She yelled at a mentally-challenged<br>
person, and that's unforgivable. <br>
 <br>
What? I'm not mentally challenged. <br>
 <br>
You're not? But that's literally <br>
 <br>
the only reason we hired you. <br>
 <br>
Would a mentally challenged<br>
person be able to do this? <br>
 <br>
Your name tag says "Big Petey". <br>
 <br>
(SCOFFS) Why do you<br>
think we all gather round <br>
 <br>
and applaud you while you ride<br>
the coin-operated horse out front? <br>
 <br>
'Cause I'm good at horses? <br>
 <br>
Wow. (CHUCKLES) I really thought... <br>

You know, we don't let<br>
all our employees insist <br>
 <br>
the customers feel their muscles<br>
after bagging their order. <br>
 <br>
Right? <br>
 <br>
Okay, fine. <br>
 <br>
Lois can come back, but you're fired. <br>
 <br>
I need you to turn<br>
in your g*n and badge. <br>

What happened to the open floor plan? <br>

Long story. The WeWork<br>
guy took our entire budget <br>

 <br>
But he has long hair and speaks<br>
confidently about the internet, <br>
 <br>
so he will get about eight more chances. <br>
 <br>
Ah, yes, the WeWork guy. <br>
 <br>
They thought he had created<br>
a $47 billion unicorn. <br>

Turns out it was only a two-bit donkey. <br>

That's wet paint, by the way. <br>
