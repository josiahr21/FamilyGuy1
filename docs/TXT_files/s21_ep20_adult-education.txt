Hi, honey, how was school today?   
 
Well, the metal detectors
were down, so the popular kids   
 
were all on edge all day,
so that was kind of fun.   
 
Oh, and we also got our yearbooks.   
 
Ooh, let me see.   
 
I love seeing what my handsome
boy's been up to all year.   
 
Oh, there's the student council,
and the cheerleaders.   
 
Peter, w-why is there
a photo of you in here?   
 
I'm in the Peter club.   
 
It's just me and this guy Jason
who joined as a joke.   
 
Jason's, like, hilarious.   
 
Wait a minute. Chris,
there's no pictures of you.   
 
Huh, I guess not.   
 
Chris, honey, I keep telling you,   
 
you need to get involved
in extracurricular activities.   
 
Otherwise you won't get into college,   
 
and you'll end up a garbageman   
 
or a congresswoman from Colorado.   
 
Okay, okay, fine.
I'll look for a club tomorrow.   
 
Your mom's right, Chris.
You got to get into college.   
 
Mostly so you can constantly   
 
jam into conversation where you went.   
 
Have you been to that new
restaurant, Kristof's, downtown?   
 
- It's amazing.
- No, but that reminds me   
 
of when I was at school in Cambridge.   
 
Oh, you went to Harvard?   
 
No, the Cambridge Technical
College for Dullards and Mutes.   
 
Not to brag, but there are
commercials for it on TV.   
 
Because it's embarrassing
to see you in jeans at church.   
 
That's why.   
 
Yeah, I'm sure it was fine
back home in Tampa.   
 
Now hold still.   
 
Hey, Brian, could you drive me
to Joann Fabrics?   
 
I'm gonna put in some elastic
'cause I've learned my lesson.   
 
Sure, just got to stop at the bank.   
 
Still getting my accounts sorted out   
 
after that Russian hacker thing.   
 
Ah, yes, that Ivan fellow.   
 
I can't believe Meg
stayed behind to be with him.   
 
Well, they seemed pretty happy together.   
 
Still, it's got to be hard
leaving your whole life behind   
 
and adapting to a foreign culture.   
 
I wonder how she's doing.

There's got to be an extracurricular

Absolutely, Chris.

Oh, really? And why is that?    
 
'Cause I know you've been
making p*rn in the school.    
 
I... You can't prove that.    
 
I heard your voice on one of the videos.    
 
(SIGHS) All right, you caught me.    
 
You see, Chris, we educators
don't make a lot of money.    
 
So, once I saw I had
the classrooms at my disposal,    
 
plus all the school A/V equipment,    
 
I realized I was only
a box of wet naps away    
 
from becoming a p*rn,
so I gave it a sh*t.    
 
Hamilton tells me you're not
supposed to throw those away.    
 
Well, it doesn't matter.
I'm not making any money.    
 
My videos hardly get any views.    
 
I think it's time for me
to throw in the sticky towel.    
 
Wow, that's a pretty sad story,
Principal Shepherd.    
 
But you want to know
the saddest part of all?    
 
Your p*rn sucks, bro.    
 
What? What are you talking about?    
 
Well, let's start with the titles.    
 
Who calls their p*rn "Man
and Woman Having Standard Sex"?    
 
You got to work the algorithm, man.    
 
You need keywords like "stepsister,"    
 
"stepbrother," "stepmom."    
 
Just put "step" and a noun
and it should work.    
 
Even "stepladder"
is getting traction these days.    
 
You know, if you want
to make this thing work    
 
and start making money,
I can help you out.    
 
You want to help me?    
 
Actually, I think
we can help each other.    
 
You need help with this thing,    
 
I need an after-school activity
so my mom gets off my back,    
 
and I think I just found it.    
 
I'm the newest member of the p*rn club.    
 
- All right, deal.
- Awesome.    
 
I feel like I've finally found
my calling, like Steve Martin.    
 
I've got it.    
 
I'll do five years of entertainment,    
 
then    years of banjo.

Honey, shut the door.

Everyone here was silenced by state

You mean that thing I said

Government is very strict

I haven't felt this kind

In fact, I took the liberty of buying us

anything this nice before.    
 
Well, you earned it.    
 
Turns out, you just needed    
 
to find something you could excel at.    
 
Thanks, Principal Shepherd.    
 
Say, how about we drive
these babies down to Chipotle

cemetery is very special place.    
 
It is here where you can
finally meet my parents.    
 
Your parents are dead?    
 
Oh, Ivan, I'm so sorry.    
 
It's okay. They d*ed peacefully
being ripped apart by dogs.

the eye-wash stations are.    
 
- Mrs. Griffin?
- Principal Shepherd,    
 
are you in on this, too?    
 
Certainly not. I have no idea
what's going on here.    
 
Principal Shepherd,
Starla is officially a no-show,    
 
so the nine-some is now an eight-some.    
 
All right, put her per diem
back in petty cash,    
 
tell Sue Ann in makeup
it's her lucky day,    
 
tell lighting it's legs up in five,    
 
and let's sh**t this thing.    
 
I mean, what?    
 
We begin with a reading
from the Russian Orthodox Bible.    
 
And Jesus said to Mikhail,    
 
"The radio you sold me last week
does not work."    
 
Mikhail said to Him, "How do I know    
 
you didn't break it on purpose
to get your money back?"    
 
Then they got in a fistfight on the bus.    
 
- Amen.
- BOTH: Amen.    
 
I now pronounce Ukraine
actually part of Russia,    
 
and I also pronounce you
husband and wife.    
 
You may share a joyless kiss.

What is there to explain?

our children's school    
 
to make p*rn?    
 
That-that you took advantage of my son?    
 
(OVERLAPPING CHATTER)    
 
This is getting away from me.    
 
Maybe I can filibuster this

for my Toyota Cressida.    
 
"Dear consumer,
making cars is really hard.    
 
There are so many parts, you guys."

Look, Principal Shepherd may
have made some bad decisions,    
 
but he didn't do it for himself.    
 
It was all to raise money
for the school.    
 
Oh, is-is that true, Principal Shepherd?    
 
Um...    
 
- Well, I-I...
- Of course it's true.    
 
Every year they slash the school budget,    
 
and this man did what he had to do    
 
to give us the education we deserve.    
 
You know the reading specialist we have?    
 
Paid for by a "Das Boot."    
 
What's a "Das Boot"?    
 
That's when a whole bunch of German men    
 
go down at the same time.    
 
He's right, everyone.    
 
With all those budget cuts,
I had no choice.    
 
It was either make p*rn,
or pass a modest tax increase    
 
on the wealthiest citizens of Quahog.    
 
A tax hike that'll affect none of us?    
 
That's the last thing we want.    
 
- Meeting adjourned.

Chris, that was some
quick thinking back there.    
 
You saved my career. Thank you.    
 
Hold it right there, Principal Shepherd.    
 
Now, I appreciate that you were
trying to help out the school,    
 
but how could you get my son
involved in something like this?    
 
- You've corrupted him.
- "Corrupted"?    
 
This was the best thing
that ever happened to me.    
 
See, before we started making p*rn,    
 
I didn't care about anything    
 
because I wasn't good at anything.    
 
But now, I'm using skills
I never knew I had.    
 
I'm writing scripts, making
schedules and balancing budgets.
