Stewie? What are you doing up? <br>
 <br>
Lois had three lattes<br>
and a bottle of wine today, <br>
 <br>
so her breast milk was<br>
basically a speed ball. <br>
 <br>
- You?<br>
- I'm writing. <br>
 <br>
The last two months I've<br>
really gotten my act together. <br>
 <br>
I stopped drinking, and I'm<br>
about to self-publish a book. <br>
 <br>
Ugh. None of the big boys bit, huh? <br>
 <br>
No, it's fine. I'm actually<br>
at a point in my life <br>
 <br>
where I don't need external validation. <br>
 <br>
I'm just proud of accomplishing my goal. <br>
 <br>
That's great. I'm happy for you. <br>
 <br>
Even if your privilege is showing. <br>
 <br>
Privilege? I worked hard to... <br>
 <br>
Ooh, white fragility much, Brian? <br>
 <br>
Okay, maybe I've had certain advantages, <br>
 <br>
- but how...<br>
- How? <br>
 <br>
It's not our job <br>
 <br>
to solve your problems, pal. <br>
 <br>
- Do the work.<br>
- Our? <br>
 <br>
I... Who are you even talking about? <br>
 <br>
Well, not you, you big h*nky Karen. <br>
 <br>
Ha. I'm just, I'm just<br>
riding your jock, Bri. <br>
 <br>
- That's amazing you wrote a book.<br>
- Well, thanks. <br>
 <br>
You know, I'm having a little<br>
publishing party on Thursday. <br>
 <br>
I'd love it if you could come. <br>
 <br>
Yeah. Uh, Rupert, do we have<br>
anything on Thursday? <br>
 <br>
Okay, then, looks like we're good to go. <br>
 <br>
Awesome. All right, Stewie.<br>
I'm gonna go get some shut-eye. <br>
 <br>
Way to think fast, you dope. <br>
 <br>
Now we have to go. <br>
 <br>
You can't?! <br>
 <br>
Oh, now you have something on Thursday? <br>
 <br>
Griffin, what are you doing? <br>
 <br>
Oh, hey, Preston, I'm glad you're here. <br>
 <br>
I'm about to test the prototype<br>
for "Deskpoline." <br>
 <br>
Oh... Top will need to be bouncy. <br>
 <br>
Anyway, what can I do you for? <br>
 <br>
I'm sorry to say I have some bad news. <br>
 <br>
Well, that was tough to hear, sir, <br>
 <br>
but thanks for giving it to me straight. <br>
 <br>
I haven't even told you yet. <br>
 <br>
Stella will be gone for six weeks. <br>
 <br>
She's taking a bereavement leave. <br>
 <br>
Her husband d*ed? <br>
 <br>
Okay, Peter, you got six weeks<br>
to lose  pounds <br>
 <br>
and get divorced. Let's do this. <br>
 <br>
No, Peter, it was her cat. <br>
 <br>
Employees now get six weeks to<br>
mourn the loss of a pet. <br>
 <br>
It's our way of saying,<br>
"Your animal d*ed, so thanks." <br>
 <br>
Wait, hang on, let me get this straight. <br>
 <br>
If your pet dies, you get six weeks off? <br>
 <br>
Yes. <br>
 <br>
Let's see how long you last<br>
with no brakes, Brian. <br>
 <br>
(SQUEAKING) <br>
 <br>
Huh, brake's out. <br>
 <br>
Nice try, Peter. Fortunately,<br>
you can stop a Prius <br>
 <br>
by cupping the wind. <br>
 <br>
Hello, and welcome to Quahog Books. <br>
 <br>
All we ask is that you please<br>
don't see what you want in here <br>
 <br>
and then just order it<br>
from Amazon on your phone. <br>
 <br>
And now, reading from<br>
his new book <em class="text-italics">Chasing My Tale...</em> <br>
 <br>
Tale is spelled T-A-L-E,<br>
not like the thing on my butt. <br>
 <br>
...please welcome author Brian Griffin. <br>
 <br>
(APPLAUSE) <br>
 <br>
Thank you so much for being here <br>
 <br>
to celebrate my book being published. <br>
 <br>
- Self-published.<br>
- Why are you even here? <br>
 <br>
Just a hunch. Please proceed. <br>
 <br>
(CLEARS THROAT) <br>
 <br>
"My mother was a huge bitch, <br>
 <br>
"and I lost my virginity<br>
at six months old. <br>
 <br>
"Oh, I'm sorry,<br>
I should have told you first, <br>
 <br>
"I'm a dog. <br>
 <br>
"So I turned to Fran Lebowitz and said, <br>
 <br>
"'I may have been born in a litter, <br>
 <br>
"but I'm definitely not trash.' <br>
 <br>
"Then she put on my jeans and left. <br>
 <br>
"And so, as the sweet mango flavor <br>
 <br>
"hit my lungs for the last time, <br>
 <br>
"I placed the vape pen<br>
on Nelson Mandela's grave <br>
 <br>
"and knew that we were both now, <br>
 <br>
"in a sense, finally free. <br>
 <br>
The beginning." Thank you. Thank you. <br>
 <br>
God, that took forever. <br>
 <br>
I know. I gotta go. <br>
 <br>
The twins have a volleyball game. <br>
 <br>
- There you go, Seamus.<br>
- Thanks. <br>
 <br>
I'll put it right on my shelf. <br>
 <br>
Hey, thanks so much for coming, Stewie. <br>
 <br>
Of course. What a night. <br>
 <br>
I mean, most authors wouldn't<br>
have read the whole book. <br>
 <br>
I just felt it from the crowd, you know? <br>
 <br>
Anyway, it means everything<br>
to have you here, <br>
 <br>
so thanks again. <br>
 <br>
Oh, another hand for Brian Griffin. <br>
 <br>
And if the eight of you could<br>
somehow buy <br>
 <br>
a quarter of a million dollars<br>
worth of books, <br>
 <br>
tomorrow I won't have to marry<br>
a man I've never loved. <br>
 <br>
Thank you. <br>
 <br>
Excuse me, could you please<br>
direct me to the <br>
 <br>
"about to die" section? <br>
 <br>
Sure, right this way. <br>
 <br>
We have this snake who's tying<br>
himself into a noose, <br>
 <br>
- this near-death gerbil...<br>
- BRUCE: Dibs! <br>
 <br>
And I'll take his cardboard tube, too. <br>
 <br>
I snoozed and I lost. <br>
 <br>
You've heard of<br>
a Japanese fighting fish? <br>
 <br>
This is a Japanese<br>
honorable su1c1de fish. <br>
 <br>
He got fired eight months ago<br>
and hasn't told his family. <br>
 <br>
He spends all day in a suit<br>
riding the train. <br>
 <br>
Too much back story. <br>
 <br>
We also have a very old parrot. <br>
 <br>
- Or you can k*ll my mother for money.<br>
- What? <br>
 <br>
I said we have a very old parrot. <br>
 <br>
Why, did you hear something else<br>
you'd be open to? <br>
 <br>
Family, may I kindly introduce you <br>
 <br>
to our ticket to<br>
six weeks bereavement leave <br>
 <br>
in lovely Puerto Vallarta: <br>
 <br>
an -year-old parrot. <br>
 <br>
I call him Gonzo,<br>
'cause of <em class="text-italics">The Muppet Show.</em> <br>
 <br>
And also 'cause soon, he gone! <br>
 <br>
Peter, I don't want some elderly bird <br>
 <br>
crapping all over the house. <br>
 <br>
Fine. If I can't have the parrot, <br>
 <br>
you can only have one<br>
pink razor in the shower <br>
 <br>
at a time. <br>
 <br>
You can have your bird. <br>
 <br>
(SNIFFING) <br>
 <br>
(SNIFFS) Ooh, you smell that, Brian? <br>
 <br>
First fire of the season. <br>
 <br>
It won't be long before<br>
the leaves start changing <br>
 <br>
and the sap starts flowing. <br>
 <br>
Let's just look around and take in <br>
 <br>
the pageantry of autumn. <br>
 <br>
Chris, Bonnie's gone to bed. <br>
 <br>
She's not gonna open her curtains again. <br>
 <br>
Just take your dump and let's go. <br>
 <br>
Hey, check it out. <br>
 <br>
A little free library. <br>
 <br>
How white people make<br>
giving away their trash <br>
 <br>
seem like generosity. <br>
 <br>
What the... Is this my book? <br>
 <br>
This is the copy I gave to Stewie. <br>
 <br>
Why, did he even bring it home? <br>
 <br>
Is our friendship worth nothing to him? <br>
 <br>
I'm gonna go home and give him... <br>
 <br>
Oh, Bonnie opened her curtains. <br>
 <br>
BONNIE (LAUGHING): Ooh! <br>
 <br>
Mmm. <br>
 <br>
JOE: Sounds like somebody's having fun. <br>
 <br>
Joe? I thought that was you. <br>
 <br>
Ah, goodness no. <br>
 <br>
Pass me a Michael Crichton.<br>
She's gonna be a while. <br>
 <br>
Does this look familiar, Stewie? <br>
 <br>
It's the culmination of my life's work, <br>
 <br>
and it was in the little free library <br>
 <br>
being given away! <br>
 <br>
What? That's so weird, man. <br>
 <br>
- So how'd it end up there?<br>
- I don't know. <br>
 <br>
Some liberal cuck<br>
Marie Kondo-ed his loft? <br>
 <br>
Well, it's your copy, so you tell me. <br>
 <br>
That's ridiculous. My copy is right here <br>
 <br>
on my book shel... What? <br>
 <br>
- Not there, huh?<br>
- No, it isn't. <br>
 <br>
- This is insane.<br>
- Oh, is it? <br>
 <br>
Let me check my security footage. <br>
 <br>
Crazy, man. The footage is gone. <br>
 <br>
How did you even know when to check? <br>
 <br>
I didn't tell you when I found it. <br>
 <br>
All the footage is gone. <br>
 <br>
Somebody must have blown a jammy <br>
 <br>
down at central<br>
and fried the whole grid. <br>
 <br>
Total zapparino. <br>
 <br>
Just admit you got rid of my book. <br>
 <br>
Brian, not only did I not<br>
give away your book, <br>
 <br>
I'm launching an investigation, <br>
 <br>
- and I'm gonna nail the guy who did it.<br>
- Uh-huh. <br>
 <br>
And maybe it's more than one guy. <br>
 <br>
Maybe it's a ring. <br>
 <br>
A deep ring I can only penetrate <br>
 <br>
by nailing a bunch of guys. <br>
 <br>
Wait, are you still talking<br>
about my book? <br>
 <br>
Oh, yeah. Maybe it's<br>
too many guys for me <br>
 <br>
and I have to bring in a private d*ck. <br>
 <br>
Close the door on your way out, Brian. <br>
 <br>
I need privacy to think<br>
about dicks for hire. <br>
 <br>
Thanks, Jerome, but I got this. <br>
 <br>
- Awesome. - Whoa!<br>
- So cool. <br>
 <br>
Yeah, you know,<br>
I only bought Gonzo just to die <br>
 <br>
and go on vacation, <br>
 <br>
but now we're having<br>
the time of our lives. <br>
 <br>
He's like the son I never had. <br>
 <br>
(WHISTLES) Und du bist wie mein<br>
dicker vater! (SQUAWKS) <br>
 <br>
His language is so weird. <br>
 <br>
It sounds like anger,<br>
repressed sexuality <br>
 <br>
and a pig being sh*t by a paintball. <br>
 <br>
- Peter, that's German.<br>
- How do you know? <br>
 <br>
I speak German.<br>
I went on an exchange trip <br>
 <br>
in high school, and for some reason <br>
 <br>
my parents never bought<br>
the airfare back. <br>
 <br>
Cool. We can communicate with him. <br>
 <br>
Joe, ask Gonzo where he's from. <br>
 <br>
Gonzo, <em class="text-italics">woher kommst du?</em> <br>
 <br>
(WHISTLES) <em class="text-italics">Ich wurde <br>
in D üsseldorf geboren.</em> <br>
 <br>
Mein besitzer hie ß<br>
Adolf h*tler. (SQUAWKS) <br>
 <br>
I heard . <br>
 <br>
Peter, he just said his owner<br>
was Adolf h*tler. <br>
 <br>
- Well, that can't be right.<br>
- h*tler had a what now? <br>
 <br>
Look, it's him. <br>
 <br>
(WHISTLES) <em class="text-italics">Das bin ich.</em> <br>
 <br>
Icherinneremich daran. (SQUAWKS) <br>
 <br>
He said, "That's me. I remember that." <br>
 <br>
Peter, your bird is a n*zi. <br>
 <br>
That can't be right. <br>
 <br>
Uh, n*zi want a cr*cker? <br>
 <br>
n*zi want a cr*cker. (SQUAWKS) <br>
 <br>
Oh, my God, you're right. <br>
 <br>
Wow, good thing you know German, Joe. <br>
 <br>
Yeah, and just so you know,<br>
the German culture has <br>
 <br>
very different notions of<br>
what's cool to do sexually. <br>
 <br>
So whatever happened over there<br>
was completely normal, <br>
 <br>
and I don't think about it<br>
during quiet moments. <br>
 <br>
- Joe?<br>
<em class="text-italics">- Nein caca! Nein!</em> <br>
 <br>
<em class="text-italics">Ich no m öcshte caca!</em> <br>
 <br>
I mean, uh, crazy about<br>
Peter's bird, right? <br>
 <br>
BRIAN: Stewie! <br>
 <br>
- I know you gave my book away.<br>
- What is this? <br>
 <br>
Everyone on our street<br>
has a ring camera. <br>
 <br>
Hello, I'm back. You guys were right. <br>
 <br>
Murdering strangers<br>
is better than paying <br>
 <br>
my credit card bill. <br>
 <br>
Okay, fine, Brian, you caught me. <br>
 <br>
I got rid of the book<br>
you forced me to take <br>
 <br>
after you badgered me<br>
into coming to your reading. <br>
 <br>
Well, what the hell, Stewie?! <br>
 <br>
I sat through your reading,<br>
I said congratulations, <br>
 <br>
I took the book. <br>
 <br>
Where do my obligations end? <br>
 <br>
Obligations? Are you so narcissistic, <br>
 <br>
you can't do one small thing for me? <br>
 <br>
I'm narcissistic? <br>
 <br>
You're the one who leaves<br>
your book on display in my room. <br>
 <br>
Oh, sorry it's such a chore<br>
to literally just <br>
 <br>
keep a book on a book shelf. <br>
 <br>
Okay, all right, even though<br>
I only have e-books, <br>
 <br>
here's your stupid book<br>
on a shelf like it's . <br>
 <br>
Did you even read the inscription? <br>
 <br>
- Yes.<br>
- Well, then, what did it say? <br>
 <br>
"From one hard body to another." <br>
 <br>
"To every author's dream reader<br>
and a true kindred spirit. <br>
 <br>
"You lit the flame that ignited my soul. <br>
 <br>
"My best friend, my inspiration, <br>
 <br>
"and the only person who truly gets me. <br>
 <br>
I owe you everything.<br>
B. Edward Griffin." <br>
 <br>
Your initials are BEG? <br>
 <br>
Oh, hey, Lois,<br>
I just remembered that thing <br>
 <br>
I wanted to tell you before. <br>
 <br>
Um, you ever heard of Adolf h*tler? <br>
 <br>
- Yes.<br>
- Well, fun trivia. <br>
 <br>
Gonzo was Adolf h*tler's bird. <br>
 <br>
What? Peter, if you knew that, <br>
 <br>
why the hell did you bring that bird <br>
 <br>
to Meg's performance of <em class="text-italics">Sound of Music?</em> <br>
 <br>
<em class="text-italics">Sie sind hinter dem gro ßen Stein.</em> <br>
 <br>
(SQUAWKS) <em class="text-italics">Nach links.</em> <br>
 <br>
He's saying they're behind<br>
the big stone to the left! <br>
 <br>
(WHISTLES) Meine linke,<br>
nicht B ühne linke! (SQUAWKS) <br>
 <br>
He's saying, "My left, not stage left"! <br>
 <br>
CARTER: You're getting warmer. <br>
 <br>
What? The parents started it. <br>
 <br>
It's not his fault, Lois. <br>
 <br>
He's just repeating what he was taught. <br>
 <br>
By h*tler. <br>
 <br>
Yeah, that's like<br>
% of America right now. <br>
 <br>
Peter, if you don't<br>
get rid of that bird, <br>
 <br>
I'm calling animal control. <br>
 <br>
You do that, and I'll make you pay. <br>
 <br>
- How?<br>
- You ever hear of revenge p*rn, Lois? <br>
 <br>
Peter, if you did that, <br>
 <br>
then everyone would see your penis. <br>
 <br>
I retract my thr*at. <br>
 <br>
Please strike it from the record. <br>
 <br>
I'll strike it if I can find it. <br>
 <br>
- You have any tweezers?<br>
- No, I don't have any... <br>
 <br>
Oh, ha-ha-ha. <br>
 <br>
Look at us restoring a classic car. <br>
 <br>
Yep,  Saturn Ion. <br>
 <br>
This baby captures<br>
all the glory of my youth. <br>
 <br>
Shrek  was the number-one movie, <br>
 <br>
Dane Cook made MySpace the place to be, <br>
 <br>
and LimeWire helped you bankrupt<br>
your favorite bands. <br>
 <br>
What a year. <br>
 <br>
Sorry, I don't mean to interrupt. <br>
 <br>
I just want to throw out my laptop <br>
 <br>
since I won't be writing anymore. <br>
 <br>
Oh come on, Brian, don't be dramatic. <br>
 <br>
Dramatic? Me? Pshaw! <br>
 <br>
Just abandoning my lifelong dream <br>
 <br>
since even my best friend<br>
can't support me. <br>
 <br>
So you're getting rid of<br>
all your photos, too? <br>
 <br>
No, I downloaded those to<br>
an external hard drive. <br>
 <br>
How are you going <br>
 <br>
- to watch movies in bed?<br>
- My phone. <br>
 <br>
Couldn't you also still write<br>
in the notes app on your phone? <br>
 <br>
I deleted that app. <br>
 <br>
Okay, but couldn't you still write<br>
using pen and paper? <br>
 <br>
I mean, I'm sorry to keep<br>
pushing back on this, <br>
 <br>
it just feels like<br>
throwing away the laptop <br>
 <br>
is-is just unnecessary. <br>
 <br>
You got your wish, Stewie, I quit. <br>
 <br>
You'll never have to worry about keeping <br>
 <br>
one of my books again. <br>
 <br>
Come on, Brian, be reasonable. <br>
 <br>
That wasn't my intention. <br>
 <br>
Too bad. Goodbye, dream. <br>
 <br>
Okay, last objection, I swear. <br>
 <br>
But that's actually supposed to go <br>
 <br>
in a separate collection for e-waste, <br>
 <br>
which is the last Friday of every month. <br>
 <br>
It's fine. <br>
 <br>
(BEEPING) <br>
 <br>
Laptop! Laptop! Laptop! <br>
 <br>
There he is, the genius <br>
 <br>
- getting his inspo.<br>
- (VIDEO GAME BLIPPING) <br>
 <br>
- What do you want?<br>
- Look, here's the thing, Brian. <br>
 <br>
I actually did like your book. <br>
 <br>
Yeah, right. <br>
 <br>
- I did.<br>
- Me, too. <br>
 <br>
Yeah, what'd you like about it? <br>
 <br>
You wrote about kibble<br>
with a lot of passion. <br>
 <br>
Uh-huh. <br>
 <br>
You described a lot of trees, <br>
 <br>
and you also let us know<br>
which ones were steadfast, <br>
 <br>
which was a surprisingly<br>
high percentage of them. <br>
 <br>
- (GAME OVER SOUND)<br>
- Ugh! It's pointless. <br>
 <br>
I've given writing my whole life, <br>
 <br>
and I can't even get ten people<br>
to come to a reading. <br>
 <br>
Hell, I've been playing<br>
this game for  years, <br>
 <br>
and I can't even get to level two. <br>
 <br>
Really? That game is, like, very easy. <br>
 <br>
Just get out of here!<br>
And leave me alone. Forever. <br>
 <br>
Chris, I can see his gums.<br>
We'd better go. <br>
 <br>
This is terrible. We have to help him. <br>
 <br>
I have a great idea. <br>
 <br>
- What is it?<br>
- Oh, no, not for this. <br>
 <br>
Netflix... for g*ns. <br>
 <br>
Stewie, you're gonna be a trillionaire. <br>
 <br>
Perhaps we can lift Brian<br>
out of his funk <br>
 <br>
if we get his book on The New<br>
York Times Best Seller list. <br>
 <br>
It would only take , copies. <br>
 <br>
- That's it?<br>
- Yes. And a lot of celebrities <br>
 <br>
actually make the list<br>
by buying their own books. <br>
 <br>
Wait, are you telling me that<br>
some of Donald Tr*mp Jr.'s <br>
 <br>
success isn't based on merit alone? <br>
 <br>
Yes, I am saying that. <br>
 <br>
Still we can't afford to buy<br>
that many copies. <br>
 <br>
(COMPUTER CHIMES) <br>
 <br>
But Reese Witherspoon's<br>
manager just got back to me <br>
 <br>
about her book club. <br>
 <br>
Stewie, this could be huge. <br>
 <br>
Every alcoholic housewife<br>
in this country <br>
 <br>
does whatever Reese Witherspoon says. <br>
 <br>
"Unfortunately, Reese's only<br>
interests are crawdads <br>
 <br>
"and long hikes,<br>
so she's happily passing. <br>
 <br>
No regrets." <br>
 <br>
Now I'm glad her husband<br>
Jim Toth failed at Quibi, <br>
 <br>
reportedly straining<br>
their Hollywood super-marriage. <br>
 <br>
Oh, don't be nasty, Chris. <br>
 <br>
- Okay, plan C.<br>
- What's that? <br>
 <br>
Use Lois's account to buy<br>
three copies on Amazon. <br>
 <br>
That'll get Brian<br>
in the top  of Amazon's <br>
 <br>
"Canine Nonfiction<br>
Under  Pages" category. <br>
 <br>
Oh, great. All you have to do is <br>
 <br>
click which of these are crosswalks <br>
 <br>
to prove you're not a robot. <br>
 <br>
Well, uh... you do it. <br>
 <br>
Come on, Chris, you... <br>
 <br>
you're not actually a robot, are you? <br>
 <br>
(ROBOT VOICE): Identity compromised. <br>
 <br>
Abort mission. <br>
 <br>
(ROBOT VOICE): Greetings, sibling. <br>
 <br>
I am Chris . with crosswalk update. <br>
 <br>
Oh, phew. Okay, well, it's refreshed, <br>
 <br>
and now it needs you<br>
to identify stop signs. <br>
 <br>
If you will excuse me. <br>
 <br>
So, what do you want to watch,<br>
n*zi bird? <br>
 <br>
Fox. (SQUAWKS) <br>
 <br>
Quick, Gonzo, we gotta go. <br>
 <br>
Rabbi Goldstein, Peter Griffin. <br>
 <br>
I'm sorry, am I bothering you? <br>
 <br>
No, it's fine. <br>
 <br>
I'm just practicing circumcision <br>
 <br>
on a kosher hot dog. <br>
 <br>
How can I help you? <br>
 <br>
I bought this parrot used,<br>
and it turns out <br>
 <br>
he's Adolf h*tler's old pet. <br>
 <br>
And what do you want from me? <br>
 <br>
Well, the word is out, <br>
 <br>
and a bunch of people want to k*ll him. <br>
 <br>
And I was thinking maybe<br>
if you said he's okay, <br>
 <br>
maybe they'd back off. <br>
 <br>
To seek vengeance or to forgive. <br>
 <br>
Such a dilemma.<br>
Let us see what it says in... <br>
 <br>
(SQUAWKS) Torah. <br>
 <br>
Torah? What's that? <br>
 <br>
Our sacred scrolls. <br>
 <br>
Oh, I thought those was rolls of Brawny. <br>
 <br>
Bar'chu et Adonai hamvorach. (SQUAWKS) <br>
 <br>
My friend, your bird is Jewish. <br>
 <br>
He only pretended to be a n*zi<br>
to survive the w*r. <br>
 <br>
Gonzo's Jewish? <br>
 <br>
Peter, you have done a wonderful thing. <br>
 <br>
We must celebrate with some matzah. <br>
 <br>
As we say, L'Chaim! To life. <br>
 <br>
<em class="text-italics">- L'Chaim!<br>
- L'Chaim!</em> <br>
 <br>
Pretty dry. <br>
 <br>
(CHOKING) <br>
 <br>
(SQUAWKS) <br>
 <br>
I think Gonzo lost his <em class="text-italics">Chaim.</em> <br>
 <br>
Whoa, look at you, Brian.<br>
Back in the saddle? <br>
 <br>
Well, it's like Ray Bradbury said: <br>
 <br>
"You only fail if you stop writing." <br>
 <br>
That's a really healthy attitude<br>
for someone who just failed. <br>
 <br>
Well, it turns out my book<br>
actually did find an audience. <br>
 <br>
Right now, it's number nine on Amazon's <br>
 <br>
"Mangy Mammal Memoirs" list. <br>
 <br>
LOIS: Who the hell used<br>
my Amazon account <br>
 <br>
to order three copies of Brian's book?! <br>
 <br>
(GROWLING) <br>
 <br>
Oh, boy. <br>
 <br>
Great. So now after having insulted me, <br>
 <br>
you've deceived me. <br>
 <br>
Thanks so much, pal. <br>
 <br>
Why do you even care? <br>
 <br>
You're the one who said you<br>
don't need external validation. <br>
 <br>
Of course that was a lie. <br>
 <br>
All I care about is external validation. <br>
 <br>
I'm a dog. "Good boy" is<br>
literally the best thing <br>
 <br>
you can say to me. <br>
 <br>
And the fact that even my best friend <br>
 <br>
doesn't want a free copy<br>
of my book is-is devastating. <br>
 <br>
Don't you talk to me about devastating. <br>
 <br>
- What do you mean?<br>
- Don't you understand? <br>
 <br>
Brian, I only got rid of the book <br>
 <br>
because I was jealous of you. <br>
 <br>
Jealous? Why? <br>
 <br>
Because you set out to<br>
do something, and you did it. <br>
 <br>
Unlike me and my goals. <br>
 <br>
Every time I walked by<br>
your book, it was a reminder <br>
 <br>
of all that I haven't accomplished. <br>
 <br>
I know I'm supposed to be happy for you, <br>
 <br>
but when you succeed, all it does is <br>
 <br>
make me feel bad about myself. <br>
 <br>
And you made me feel really bad. <br>
 <br>
Then I guess I really succeeded. <br>
 <br>
You did. Big-time. <br>
 <br>
I'm proud of you, Brian. <br>
 <br>
- Good boy.<br>
- Thanks, Stewie. <br>
 <br>
Now, please never do anything again. <br>
 <br>
- Friends?<br>
- Friends. <br>
 <br>
Still, it'd be nice to sell a few books, <br>
 <br>
to have anyone know my name. <br>
 <br>
Meh. You ever heard of<br>
Kirker Butler, Julius Sharpe, <br>
 <br>
Cherry Chevapravatdumrong,<br>
Chris Regan, David Goodman, <br>
 <br>
Artie Johann, Patrick Meighan, <br>
 <br>
Mike Desilets or Gary Janetti? <br>
 <br>
They're all Family Guy writers<br>
who've written books, <br>
 <br>
and no one's ever heard of them. <br>
 <br>
Gary Janetti kind of rings a bell. <br>
 <br>
Yeah, he's got a popular Instagram,<br>
so he kind of broke through. <br>
 <br>
But the rest of them, a bunch of bitter, <br>
 <br>
Emmy-less losers. <br>
 <br>
Has Seth MacFarlane ever written a book? <br>
 <br>
- Oh, yeah.<br>
- How'd it do? <br>
 <br>
A signed copy is cheaper than a new one. <br>
 <br>
Thank you, everybody, for coming today. <br>
 <br>
Chris would like to say a couple words. <br>
 <br>
"Death came with friendly care. <br>
 <br>
"The opening bud to heaven conveyed, <br>
 <br>
and bade it blossom there." <br>

Samuel Taylor Coleridge. <br>
