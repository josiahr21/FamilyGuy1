Stewie? What are you doing up?  
  
Lois had three lattes 
and a bottle of wine today,  
  
so her breast milk was 
basically a speed ball.  
  
- You? 
- I'm writing.  
  
The last two months I've 
really gotten my act together.  
  
I stopped drinking, and I'm 
about to self-publish a book.  
  
Ugh. None of the big boys bit, huh?  
  
No, it's fine. I'm actually 
at a point in my life  
  
where I don't need external validation.  
  
I'm just proud of accomplishing my goal.  
  
That's great. I'm happy for you.  
  
Even if your privilege is showing.  
  
Privilege? I worked hard to...  
  
Ooh, white fragility much, Brian?  
  
Okay, maybe I've had certain advantages,  
  
- but how... 
- How?  
  
It's not our job  
  
to solve your problems, pal.  
  
- Do the work. 
- Our?  
  
I... Who are you even talking about?  
  
Well, not you, you big h*nky Karen.  
  
Ha. I'm just, I'm just 
riding your jock, Bri.  
  
- That's amazing you wrote a book. 
- Well, thanks.  
  
You know, I'm having a little 
publishing party on Thursday.  
  
I'd love it if you could come.  
  
Yeah. Uh, Rupert, do we have 
anything on Thursday?  
  
Okay, then, looks like we're good to go.  
  
Awesome. All right, Stewie. 
I'm gonna go get some shut-eye.  
  
Way to think fast, you dope.  
  
Now we have to go.  
  
You can't?!  
  
Oh, now you have something on Thursday?  
  
Griffin, what are you doing?  
  
Oh, hey, Preston, I'm glad you're here.  
  
I'm about to test the prototype 
for "Deskpoline."  
  
Oh... Top will need to be bouncy.  
  
Anyway, what can I do you for?  
  
I'm sorry to say I have some bad news.  
  
Well, that was tough to hear, sir,  
  
but thanks for giving it to me straight.  
  
I haven't even told you yet.  
  
Stella will be gone for six weeks.  
  
She's taking a bereavement leave.  
  
Her husband d*ed?  
  
Okay, Peter, you got six weeks 
to lose  pounds  
  
and get divorced. Let's do this.  
  
No, Peter, it was her cat.  
  
Employees now get six weeks to 
mourn the loss of a pet.  
  
It's our way of saying, 
"Your animal d*ed, so thanks."  
  
Wait, hang on, let me get this straight.  
  
If your pet dies, you get six weeks off?  
  
Yes.  
  
Let's see how long you last 
with no brakes, Brian.  
  
(SQUEAKING)  
  
Huh, brake's out.  
  
Nice try, Peter. Fortunately, 
you can stop a Prius  
  
by cupping the wind.  
  
Hello, and welcome to Quahog Books.  
  
All we ask is that you please 
don't see what you want in here  
  
and then just order it 
from Amazon on your phone.  
  
And now, reading from 
his new book <em class="text-italics">Chasing My Tale...</em>  
  
Tale is spelled T-A-L-E, 
not like the thing on my butt.  
  
...please welcome author Brian Griffin.  
  
(APPLAUSE)  
  
Thank you so much for being here  
  
to celebrate my book being published.  
  
- Self-published. 
- Why are you even here?  
  
Just a hunch. Please proceed.  
  
(CLEARS THROAT)  
  
"My mother was a huge bitch,  
  
"and I lost my virginity 
at six months old.  
  
"Oh, I'm sorry, 
I should have told you first,  
  
"I'm a dog.  
  
"So I turned to Fran Lebowitz and said,  
  
"'I may have been born in a litter,  
  
"but I'm definitely not trash.'  
  
"Then she put on my jeans and left.  
  
"And so, as the sweet mango flavor  
  
"hit my lungs for the last time,  
  
"I placed the vape pen 
on Nelson Mandela's grave  
  
"and knew that we were both now,  
  
"in a sense, finally free.  
  
The beginning." Thank you. Thank you.  
  
God, that took forever.  
  
I know. I gotta go.  
  
The twins have a volleyball game.  
  
- There you go, Seamus. 
- Thanks.  
  
I'll put it right on my shelf.  
  
Hey, thanks so much for coming, Stewie.  
  
Of course. What a night.  
  
I mean, most authors wouldn't 
have read the whole book.  
  
I just felt it from the crowd, you know?  
  
Anyway, it means everything 
to have you here,  
  
so thanks again.  
  
Oh, another hand for Brian Griffin.  
  
And if the eight of you could 
somehow buy  
  
a quarter of a million dollars 
worth of books,  
  
tomorrow I won't have to marry 
a man I've never loved.  
  
Thank you.  
  
Excuse me, could you please 
direct me to the  
  
"about to die" section?  
  
Sure, right this way.  
  
We have this snake who's tying 
himself into a noose,  
  
- this near-death gerbil... 
- BRUCE: Dibs!  
  
And I'll take his cardboard tube, too.  
  
I snoozed and I lost.  
  
You've heard of 
a Japanese fighting fish?  
  
This is a Japanese 
honorable su1c1de fish.  
  
He got fired eight months ago 
and hasn't told his family.  
  
He spends all day in a suit 
riding the train.  
  
Too much back story.  
  
We also have a very old parrot.  
  
- Or you can k*ll my mother for money. 
- What?  
  
I said we have a very old parrot.  
  
Why, did you hear something else 
you'd be open to?  
  
Family, may I kindly introduce you  
  
to our ticket to 
six weeks bereavement leave  
  
in lovely Puerto Vallarta:  
  
an -year-old parrot.  
  
I call him Gonzo, 
'cause of <em class="text-italics">The Muppet Show.</em>  
  
And also 'cause soon, he gone!  
  
Peter, I don't want some elderly bird  
  
crapping all over the house.  
  
Fine. If I can't have the parrot,  
  
you can only have one 
pink razor in the shower  
  
at a time.  
  
You can have your bird.  
  
(SNIFFING)  
  
(SNIFFS) Ooh, you smell that, Brian?  
  
First fire of the season.  
  
It won't be long before 
the leaves start changing  
  
and the sap starts flowing.  
  
Let's just look around and take in  
  
the pageantry of autumn.  
  
Chris, Bonnie's gone to bed.  
  
She's not gonna open her curtains again.  
  
Just take your dump and let's go.  
  
Hey, check it out.  
  
A little free library.  
  
How white people make 
giving away their trash  
  
seem like generosity.  
  
What the... Is this my book?  
  
This is the copy I gave to Stewie.  
  
Why, did he even bring it home?  
  
Is our friendship worth nothing to him?  
  
I'm gonna go home and give him...  
  
Oh, Bonnie opened her curtains.  
  
BONNIE (LAUGHING): Ooh!  
  
Mmm.  
  
JOE: Sounds like somebody's having fun.  
  
Joe? I thought that was you.  
  
Ah, goodness no.  
  
Pass me a Michael Crichton. 
She's gonna be a while.  
  
Does this look familiar, Stewie?  
  
It's the culmination of my life's work,  
  
and it was in the little free library  
  
being given away!  
  
What? That's so weird, man.  
  
- So how'd it end up there? 
- I don't know.  
  
Some liberal cuck 
Marie Kondo-ed his loft?  
  
Well, it's your copy, so you tell me.  
  
That's ridiculous. My copy is right here  
  
on my book shel... What?  
  
- Not there, huh? 
- No, it isn't.  
  
- This is insane. 
- Oh, is it?  
  
Let me check my security footage.  
  
Crazy, man. The footage is gone.  
  
How did you even know when to check?  
  
I didn't tell you when I found it.  
  
All the footage is gone.  
  
Somebody must have blown a jammy  
  
down at central 
and fried the whole grid.  
  
Total zapparino.  
  
Just admit you got rid of my book.  
  
Brian, not only did I not 
give away your book,  
  
I'm launching an investigation,  
  
- and I'm gonna nail the guy who did it. 
- Uh-huh.  
  
And maybe it's more than one guy.  
  
Maybe it's a ring.  
  
A deep ring I can only penetrate  
  
by nailing a bunch of guys.  
  
Wait, are you still talking 
about my book?  
  
Oh, yeah. Maybe it's 
too many guys for me  
  
and I have to bring in a private d*ck.  
  
Close the door on your way out, Brian.  
  
I need privacy to think 
about dicks for hire.  
  
Thanks, Jerome, but I got this.  
  
- Awesome. - Whoa! 
- So cool.  
  
Yeah, you know, 
I only bought Gonzo just to die  
  
and go on vacation,  
  
but now we're having 
the time of our lives.  
  
He's like the son I never had.  
  
(WHISTLES) Und du bist wie mein 
dicker vater! (SQUAWKS)  
  
His language is so weird.  
  
It sounds like anger, 
repressed sexuality  
  
and a pig being sh*t by a paintball.  
  
- Peter, that's German. 
- How do you know?  
  
I speak German. 
I went on an exchange trip  
  
in high school, and for some reason  
  
my parents never bought 
the airfare back.  
  
Cool. We can communicate with him.  
  
Joe, ask Gonzo where he's from.  
  
Gonzo, <em class="text-italics">woher kommst du?</em>  
  
(WHISTLES) <em class="text-italics">Ich wurde  
in D üsseldorf geboren.</em>  
  
Mein besitzer hie ß 
Adolf h*tler. (SQUAWKS)  
  
I heard .  
  
Peter, he just said his owner 
was Adolf h*tler.  
  
- Well, that can't be right. 
- h*tler had a what now?  
  
Look, it's him.  
  
(WHISTLES) <em class="text-italics">Das bin ich.</em>  
  
Icherinneremich daran. (SQUAWKS)  
  
He said, "That's me. I remember that."  
  
Peter, your bird is a n*zi.  
  
That can't be right.  
  
Uh, n*zi want a cr*cker?  
  
n*zi want a cr*cker. (SQUAWKS)  
  
Oh, my God, you're right.  
  
Wow, good thing you know German, Joe.  
  
Yeah, and just so you know, 
the German culture has  
  
very different notions of 
what's cool to do sexually.  
  
So whatever happened over there 
was completely normal,  
  
and I don't think about it 
during quiet moments.  
  
- Joe? 
<em class="text-italics">- Nein caca! Nein!</em>  
  
<em class="text-italics">Ich no m öcshte caca!</em>  
  
I mean, uh, crazy about 
Peter's bird, right?  
  
BRIAN: Stewie!  
  
- I know you gave my book away. 
- What is this?  
  
Everyone on our street 
has a ring camera.  
  
Hello, I'm back. You guys were right.  
  
Murdering strangers 
is better than paying  
  
my credit card bill.  
  
Okay, fine, Brian, you caught me.  
  
I got rid of the book 
you forced me to take  
  
after you badgered me 
into coming to your reading.  
  
Well, what the hell, Stewie?!  
  
I sat through your reading, 
I said congratulations,  
  
I took the book.  
  
Where do my obligations end?  
  
Obligations? Are you so narcissistic,  
  
you can't do one small thing for me?  
  
I'm narcissistic?  
  
You're the one who leaves 
your book on display in my room.  
  
Oh, sorry it's such a chore 
to literally just  
  
keep a book on a book shelf.  
  
Okay, all right, even though 
I only have e-books,  
  
here's your stupid book 
on a shelf like it's .  
  
Did you even read the inscription?  
  
- Yes. 
- Well, then, what did it say?  
  
"From one hard body to another."  
  
"To every author's dream reader 
and a true kindred spirit.  
  
"You lit the flame that ignited my soul.  
  
"My best friend, my inspiration,  
  
"and the only person who truly gets me.  
  
I owe you everything. 
B. Edward Griffin."  
  
Your initials are BEG?  
  
Oh, hey, Lois, 
I just remembered that thing  
  
I wanted to tell you before.  
  
Um, you ever heard of Adolf h*tler?  
  
- Yes. 
- Well, fun trivia.  
  
Gonzo was Adolf h*tler's bird.  
  
What? Peter, if you knew that,  
  
why the hell did you bring that bird  
  
to Meg's performance of <em class="text-italics">Sound of Music?</em>  
  
<em class="text-italics">Sie sind hinter dem gro ßen Stein.</em>  
  
(SQUAWKS) <em class="text-italics">Nach links.</em>  
  
He's saying they're behind 
the big stone to the left!  
  
(WHISTLES) Meine linke, 
nicht B ühne linke! (SQUAWKS)  
  
He's saying, "My left, not stage left"!  
  
CARTER: You're getting warmer.  
  
What? The parents started it.  
  
It's not his fault, Lois.  
  
He's just repeating what he was taught.  
  
By h*tler.  
  
Yeah, that's like 
% of America right now.  
  
Peter, if you don't 
get rid of that bird,  
  
I'm calling animal control.  
  
You do that, and I'll make you pay.  
  
- How? 
- You ever hear of revenge p*rn, Lois?  
  
Peter, if you did that,  
  
then everyone would see your penis.  
  
I retract my thr*at.  
  
Please strike it from the record.  
  
I'll strike it if I can find it.  
  
- You have any tweezers? 
- No, I don't have any...  
  
Oh, ha-ha-ha.  
  
Look at us restoring a classic car.  
  
Yep,  Saturn Ion.  
  
This baby captures 
all the glory of my youth.  
  
Shrek  was the number-one movie,  
  
Dane Cook made MySpace the place to be,  
  
and LimeWire helped you bankrupt 
your favorite bands.  
  
What a year.  
  
Sorry, I don't mean to interrupt.  
  
I just want to throw out my laptop  
  
since I won't be writing anymore.  
  
Oh come on, Brian, don't be dramatic.  
  
Dramatic? Me? Pshaw!  
  
Just abandoning my lifelong dream  
  
since even my best friend 
can't support me.  
  
So you're getting rid of 
all your photos, too?  
  
No, I downloaded those to 
an external hard drive.  
  
How are you going  
  
- to watch movies in bed? 
- My phone.  
  
Couldn't you also still write 
in the notes app on your phone?  
  
I deleted that app.  
  
Okay, but couldn't you still write 
using pen and paper?  
  
I mean, I'm sorry to keep 
pushing back on this,  
  
it just feels like 
throwing away the laptop  
  
is-is just unnecessary.  
  
You got your wish, Stewie, I quit.  
  
You'll never have to worry about keeping  
  
one of my books again.  
  
Come on, Brian, be reasonable.  
  
That wasn't my intention.  
  
Too bad. Goodbye, dream.  
  
Okay, last objection, I swear.  
  
But that's actually supposed to go  
  
in a separate collection for e-waste,  
  
which is the last Friday of every month.  
  
It's fine.  
  
(BEEPING)  
  
Laptop! Laptop! Laptop!  
  
There he is, the genius  
  
- getting his inspo. 
- (VIDEO GAME BLIPPING)  
  
- What do you want? 
- Look, here's the thing, Brian.  
  
I actually did like your book.  
  
Yeah, right.  
  
- I did. 
- Me, too.  
  
Yeah, what'd you like about it?  
  
You wrote about kibble 
with a lot of passion.  
  
Uh-huh.  
  
You described a lot of trees,  
  
and you also let us know 
which ones were steadfast,  
  
which was a surprisingly 
high percentage of them.  
  
- (GAME OVER SOUND) 
- Ugh! It's pointless.  
  
I've given writing my whole life,  
  
and I can't even get ten people 
to come to a reading.  
  
Hell, I've been playing 
this game for  years,  
  
and I can't even get to level two.  
  
Really? That game is, like, very easy.  
  
Just get out of here! 
And leave me alone. Forever.  
  
Chris, I can see his gums. 
We'd better go.  
  
This is terrible. We have to help him.  
  
I have a great idea.  
  
- What is it? 
- Oh, no, not for this.  
  
Netflix... for g*ns.  
  
Stewie, you're gonna be a trillionaire.  
  
Perhaps we can lift Brian 
out of his funk  
  
if we get his book on The New 
York Times Best Seller list.  
  
It would only take , copies.  
  
- That's it? 
- Yes. And a lot of celebrities  
  
actually make the list 
by buying their own books.  
  
Wait, are you telling me that 
some of Donald Tr*mp Jr.'s  
  
success isn't based on merit alone?  
  
Yes, I am saying that.  
  
Still we can't afford to buy 
that many copies.  
  
(COMPUTER CHIMES)  
  
But Reese Witherspoon's 
manager just got back to me  
  
about her book club.  
  
Stewie, this could be huge.  
  
Every alcoholic housewife 
in this country  
  
does whatever Reese Witherspoon says.  
  
"Unfortunately, Reese's only 
interests are crawdads  
  
"and long hikes, 
so she's happily passing.  
  
No regrets."  
  
Now I'm glad her husband 
Jim Toth failed at Quibi,  
  
reportedly straining 
their Hollywood super-marriage.  
  
Oh, don't be nasty, Chris.  
  
- Okay, plan C. 
- What's that?  
  
Use Lois's account to buy 
three copies on Amazon.  
  
That'll get Brian 
in the top  of Amazon's  
  
"Canine Nonfiction 
Under  Pages" category.  
  
Oh, great. All you have to do is  
  
click which of these are crosswalks  
  
to prove you're not a robot.  
  
Well, uh... you do it.  
  
Come on, Chris, you...  
  
you're not actually a robot, are you?  
  
(ROBOT VOICE): Identity compromised.  
  
Abort mission.  
  
(ROBOT VOICE): Greetings, sibling.  
  
I am Chris . with crosswalk update.  
  
Oh, phew. Okay, well, it's refreshed,  
  
and now it needs you 
to identify stop signs.  
  
If you will excuse me.  
  
So, what do you want to watch, 
n*zi bird?  
  
Fox. (SQUAWKS)  
  
Quick, Gonzo, we gotta go.  
  
Rabbi Goldstein, Peter Griffin.  
  
I'm sorry, am I bothering you?  
  
No, it's fine.  
  
I'm just practicing circumcision  
  
on a kosher hot dog.  
  
How can I help you?  
  
I bought this parrot used, 
and it turns out  
  
he's Adolf h*tler's old pet.  
  
And what do you want from me?  
  
Well, the word is out,  
  
and a bunch of people want to k*ll him.  
  
And I was thinking maybe 
if you said he's okay,  
  
maybe they'd back off.  
  
To seek vengeance or to forgive.  
  
Such a dilemma. 
Let us see what it says in...  
  
(SQUAWKS) Torah.  
  
Torah? What's that?  
  
Our sacred scrolls.  
  
Oh, I thought those was rolls of Brawny.  
  
Bar'chu et Adonai hamvorach. (SQUAWKS)  
  
My friend, your bird is Jewish.  
  
He only pretended to be a n*zi 
to survive the w*r.  
  
Gonzo's Jewish?  
  
Peter, you have done a wonderful thing.  
  
We must celebrate with some matzah.  
  
As we say, L'Chaim! To life.  
  
<em class="text-italics">- L'Chaim! 
- L'Chaim!</em>  
  
Pretty dry.  
  
(CHOKING)  
  
(SQUAWKS)  
  
I think Gonzo lost his <em class="text-italics">Chaim.</em>  
  
Whoa, look at you, Brian. 
Back in the saddle?  
  
Well, it's like Ray Bradbury said:  
  
"You only fail if you stop writing."  
  
That's a really healthy attitude 
for someone who just failed.  
  
Well, it turns out my book 
actually did find an audience.  
  
Right now, it's number nine on Amazon's  
  
"Mangy Mammal Memoirs" list.  
  
LOIS: Who the hell used 
my Amazon account  
  
to order three copies of Brian's book?!  
  
(GROWLING)  
  
Oh, boy.  
  
Great. So now after having insulted me,  
  
you've deceived me.  
  
Thanks so much, pal.  
  
Why do you even care?  
  
You're the one who said you 
don't need external validation.  
  
Of course that was a lie.  
  
All I care about is external validation.  
  
I'm a dog. "Good boy" is 
literally the best thing  
  
you can say to me.  
  
And the fact that even my best friend  
  
doesn't want a free copy 
of my book is-is devastating.  
  
Don't you talk to me about devastating.  
  
- What do you mean? 
- Don't you understand?  
  
Brian, I only got rid of the book  
  
because I was jealous of you.  
  
Jealous? Why?  
  
Because you set out to 
do something, and you did it.  
  
Unlike me and my goals.  
  
Every time I walked by 
your book, it was a reminder  
  
of all that I haven't accomplished.  
  
I know I'm supposed to be happy for you,  
  
but when you succeed, all it does is  
  
make me feel bad about myself.  
  
And you made me feel really bad.  
  
Then I guess I really succeeded.  
  
You did. Big-time.  
  
I'm proud of you, Brian.  
  
- Good boy. 
- Thanks, Stewie.  
  
Now, please never do anything again.  
  
- Friends? 
- Friends.  
  
Still, it'd be nice to sell a few books,  
  
to have anyone know my name.  
  
Meh. You ever heard of 
Kirker Butler, Julius Sharpe,  
  
Cherry Chevapravatdumrong, 
Chris Regan, David Goodman,  
  
Artie Johann, Patrick Meighan,  
  
Mike Desilets or Gary Janetti?  
  
They're all Family Guy writers 
who've written books,  
  
and no one's ever heard of them.  
  
Gary Janetti kind of rings a bell.  
  
Yeah, he's got a popular Instagram, 
so he kind of broke through.  
  
But the rest of them, a bunch of bitter,  
  
Emmy-less losers.  
  
Has Seth MacFarlane ever written a book?  
  
- Oh, yeah. 
- How'd it do?  
  
A signed copy is cheaper than a new one.  
  
Thank you, everybody, for coming today.  
  
Chris would like to say a couple words.  
  
"Death came with friendly care.  
  
"The opening bud to heaven conveyed,  
  
and bade it blossom there."  
  
Samuel Taylor Coleridge.
