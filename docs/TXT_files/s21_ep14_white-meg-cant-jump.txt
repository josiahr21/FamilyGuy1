Meg's got the ball.      
   
Peter, quick, write something mean.      
   
"You're doing to this game  
what R. Kelly did to all tho..."      
   
Yeah, no, no, I'm not saying  
the rest of that.      
   
- (WHISTLE BLOWS)  
- (SIGHS) Peter, you're too slow.      
   
Let me try to give her the business.      
   
Uh, Meg, honey,  
you used to walk pigeon-toed      
   
but got better with the right shoes!      
   
(BUZZER SOUNDS)      
   
(CROWD JEERS)      
   
Well, that'll do it      
   
from the Adam West High Gymnasium,      
   
where the home team goes down  
in a nine-seven slugfest.      
   
We're so sorry, honey.      
   
Yeah, but it turns out      
   
our team is still advancing  
to the championship game.      
   
- Really?  
- Yeah.      
   
The other team was disqualified  
from the league.      
   
I guess one of them  
was Gilbert Gottfried.      
   
I have to do something.      
   
Y'all mind if I record this      
   
for teaching purposes or whatever?      
   
Sure.      
   
Now, Mrs. Padberry-Wilkerson,      
   
can you tell me about  
Stewie's "problem"?      
   
(HIGH-PITCHED): Well,  
it's not something a proper lady      
   
is used to talking about,      
   
but I believe it was something he saw.      
   
(SOUTHERN ACCENT): What's  
the big deal? It's just sex.      
   
Mrs. Padberry-Winkie-Woo is just a prude      
   
who's never gotten enough "vitamin D,"      
   
if you know what I mean.      
   
(HIGH-PITCHED): Excuse me.      
   
I will have you know  
I am a tigress in the bedroom.      
   
- This is ridiculous.  
- Shh.      
   
I find the best thing to do  
with multiple personalities      
   
is to summon them all      
   
and let them work out they differences.      
   
(SOUTHERN ACCENT):  
Oh, is that so, Miss Tigress?      
   
(HIGH-PITCHED): Quite right.      
   
(SOUTHERN ACCENT): How's  
about you hoist off them BVDs,      
   
and I do you on a front yard couch?      
   
(HIGH-PITCHED): Why, Mr. Boone,  
you're terrible. Don't stop.      
   
(SOUTHERN ACCENT): I ain't gonna.      
   
- (MOANING)  
- Enough. Stewie.      
   
You're losing it because  
you haven't napped in days.      
   
You're cranky. You're scared.      
   
Listen, what you saw  
in Peter and Lois's bedroom      
   
is not what you think.      
   
It was just... Lois looking  
very closely at the sheets      
   
so she could check the thread count.      
   
And Peter was just...  
cheering her on from behind.      
   
Really? That makes sense.      
   
I like that. Phew.      
   
Ah, I guess I really could use a nap.      
   
Sometimes you just have to trust  
what your parents tell you.      
   
- It's in your best interest.  
- Yes, maybe you're right.      
   
(HIGH-PITCHED): Determining thread count  
with the naked eye would take hours.
