        <h1>Data Analysis with AntConc</h1>
        <p>For our Data Analysis, we wanted to see how often certain characters appeared throughout
            the show. We first started with the main character, Peter Griffin.</p>
        <img src="Peter1.png" alt="Peter" width="700" height="450" class="center" />
        <p>We wanted to view the most common phrases with Peter's name. We found it was best to use
            three worded phrases as two worded phrases were mostly the same. With four and five
            worded phrases, they became less common which was not useful in our findings. For the
            most part, the word "peter" shows up the most in season 22 episode five, Baby It's Cold
            Inside.</p>

        <p>For our next analysis, we wanted to view how often Brian shows up within the show.</p>
        <img src="Brian1.png" alt="Brian" width="700" height="450" class="center"/>
        <p>Additionally, we wante dto see themost common phrases that include Brian's name. He is one of the most popular characters in Family Guy, not including Peter.</p>
