            <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
            <p>For our Data Analysis, we wanted to see how often certain characters appeared
                throughout the show. We first started with the main character, Peter Griffin.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="Peter1.png" alt="Peter" width="700" height="450" class="center" />
            </div>
            <p>We wanted to view the most common phrases with Peter's name. We found it was best to
                use three worded phrases as two worded phrases were mostly the same. With four and
                five worded phrases, they became less common which was not useful in our findings.
                For the most part, the word "peter" shows up the most in season 22 episode five,
                "Baby It's Cold Inside".</p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="Peter2.png" alt="Peter" width="700" height="450" class="center" />
            </div>
            <h2>SVG</h2>
            <p>Additionally, we wanted to see the most common phrases that include Brian's name. He
                is one of the most popular characters in Family Guy, not including Peter. We wanted
                to show the most commonly referred to characters with an SVG graph.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="familyguy.svg" alt="FamilyGuy" width="700" height="450" class="center" />
            </div>
            <h2>Jupyter Notebook</h2>
            <p>For our Jupyter Notebook, we wanted to analyze the amount of pop culture references
                that were inside of the show. This is similar to how the popular music website,
                Genius operates. In our output we found that Peter, highlighted, has the most
                connections to the other characters in the show.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="jupyter.png" alt="Brian" width="700" height="450" class="center" />
