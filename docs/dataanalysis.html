        <h1>Data Analysis with AntConc</h1>
        <p>For our Data Analysis, we wanted to see how often certain characters appeared throughout
            the show. We first started with the main character, Peter Griffin.</p>
        <img src="Peter1.png" alt="Peter" width="700" height="450" class="center" />
        <p>We wanted to view the most common phrases with Peter's name. We found it was best to use
            three worded phrases as two worded phrases were mostly the same. With four and five
            worded phrases, they became less common which was not useful in our findings</p>
