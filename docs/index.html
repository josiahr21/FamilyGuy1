            <p>Our data collection is from season 21 and 22 of Family Guy. As we created our
                project, season 22 continues to release episodes. We stopped adding to our database
                at the end of March with epsiode 13, Lifeguard Meg. Our inspiration for this project
                stems from the popular music website known as Genius. They are a music encyclopedia
                page that hosts thousonds upon thousands of song transcripts. One thing that makes
                them unique is they offer pop-ups on certain lyrics to provide some context. On
                these pop-ups, fans can comment their own opinion on what they believe the lyric
                means</p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <button onclick="document.getElementById('myGif').src='peter.gif'">Play</button>
                
                
                <img src="peter.gif" alt="Family GIF" class="center">
                
                <button onclick="document.getElementById('myGif').src='peter.gif'">Pause</button>

            <h1>Project Info</h1>
            <p>Our project's purpose was to conduct a complete analysis and comprehension of Family
                Guy season 21 and 22 episode 13 by getting text files from each season's episodes
                and using them to create graphs to assist us comprehend the information better. </p>
            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>Some of the problems we encountered was getting the Jupyter notebook setup. Liz and
                Josiah switched turns working on the notebook. For Josiah, one of the biggest
                problems he faced was simply fixing the syntax of the code. After we solved that
                issue, we were off to the races. It was fairly easy for Josiah and Hattie to formate
                and organize the websit with indentations and spacing.</p>
