        <p>Our data collection is from season 21 and 22 of Family Guy. As we created our project,
            season 22 continues to release episodes. We stopped adding to our website at the end of
            March with epsiode 13, Lifeguard Meg. </p>
        <p>Our inspiration for this project stems from the popular music website known as Genius.
            They are a music encyclopedia page that hosts thousonds upon thousands of song
            transcripts. One thing that makes them unique is they offer pop-ups on certain lyrics o
            provide some context. On these pop-ups, fans can comment their own opinion on what they
            believe the lyric means.</p>
