        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p>This project was designed and completed from March to May 2024 for Penn State Behrend's
            Large-Scale Text Analysis class. In this project, each member gathered text (.txt) files
            for Family Guy episodes from seasons 21 and 22. We were able to use Jupyter Notebook and
            Antconc to acquire a better knowledge of the show. </p>
