        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p>This project was designed and completed in May 2024 for Penn State Behrend's Large-Scale
            Text Analysis class.In this project, each member gathered text (.txt) files for Family
            Guy episodes from seasons 21 and 22. We were able to use Jupyter Notebook and Antconc to
            acquire a better knowledge of the show. </p>
