Eh, our I.T. guy told me

[QUAGMIRE] I knew I
needed to get in shape,

but the only forms of
exercise in the '80s were

roller-skating on a dance floor

or lugging around your dead
boss to use his vacation home.

Back then, there were
two things I liked:

Gyrating my pelvis

and putting vowels next to each other

that weren't normally
next to each other.

I combined those two loves

to create something called "aerobics."
