This is the shirt you chose?

Denim, with all the

Yeah, it's the fanciest shirt I have.

But Warner Brothers wouldn't

Eh, how are you, Doctor?

Oh, my God, will you look at this?

Bonnie's latest post has likes.

That's tied for the record.

That's good, but it should say,

No, no, no, it's because

So... I love that.

Hey, kids, I'm Mr. Andy,
and I just invented

this really crazy game.

One person hides in a top secret spot,

and the others count to ten,
then try and find him.

We'll call it, oh, I don't know,
"hide-and-seek"?

I say, one game covering
covert activity,

surveillance and counting?

I would follow this man into
the very bowels of hell.

All right, who wants to hide first?

Oh, me, me.

Looks like we have
our first little hider.

I'm so glad they didn't fire you
for giving us baths.

Okay, it's time to bid on our
final donated item of the night:

a romantic Vermont weekend getaway.

(GASP) Peter, we have to win.

Vermont is an Instagram goldmine.

I could shatter Bonnie's record.

Lois, we can't afford...

I'll take you to Ben & Jerry's.

I have $ taped to my stomach.

$ !

Sold. There were no other bids.
You could have had it for $ .

(STAMMERING)

That concludes this scene,
ladies and gentlemen.

(SLIDE WHISTLE)

Chris, what... Oh, who cares?

We're in Vermont till Sunday.

Call if you have to
but, like, let's not call.

Can we only brush our teeth
for seconds

instead of the full ?

You brush your teeth? Nerd.

And remember, kids, if you get nervous,

you can always turn on
the home security system.

That's right. The keypad code is .

If your mother doesn't want to do it,

at least she can type it.

You're a legend, Dad.

Hey, Brian, can you find me?

What the... Is that a talking blanket?

It's me. It's crazy, right?

It's this brand-new game
called hide-and-seek.

Basically a peekaboo
on Flintstones Vitamins.

- Let's play
- Fine.

But like all adults, on my turns,

I'll only hide in beds
so I can take little naps.

I'll start counting. Go upstairs.

Whoa, I never even thought about
hiding upstairs.

This is a game changer, like Twitch.

YOUTUBER: Normal voice.
Playing Minecraft, quiet-normal.

Loudest scream possible!

Kinda quiet, normal-quiet, Minecraft.

Scorching-hot audio levels!

Oh, my God.

Pretty cool spot, eh, Bri?

Do all kids know what a good spot

a closed-door refrigerator is?

No. Don't ever hide in there.
Could you even breathe?

No. It's a good thing
you were looking for me.

Stewie, no. Very bad.

What the hell was that?

A spanking. That was me spanking you.

That's it? Brian,
you either gotta be that guy

or-or not be that guy.

I-I don't... I don't know what that was.

Oh, God, she did it again.

- Who?
- Bonnie.

Every time I do a post,
she does one right after.

- So what?
- So what?

It undercuts my post's popularity.

Like Armageddon and Deep Impact.

Oh, yeah, that was weird.

Can you imagine you just
wrapped principle sh**ting

on Volcano, and you're very proud of it,

and then bam, here comes Dante's Peak?

One more and I'll get it.

You've just finished
a comprehensive retelling

of early ' s middle-distance
running in Oregon

with Prefontaine,

and then boom, your Leto gets Crudup'ed

Sorry, I was tracking
two ladies holding hands,

and they just kissed goodbye,
so I've been elsewhere.

Wha-What were you saying?
Y-You like movies or something?

Ah, look at this.

A glassblowing class.

That kind of crap is perfect
for Instagram.

(PHONE CHIMES)

Oh, I'm so b*at.

Me and Rupert played H&S...

Quicker way to say hide-and-seek...

All night, until like : p. m.

I'm not even joking. Wanna play?

Not now. I'm trying to get
this TED Talk onto the TV.

I can see the p*rn logo
reflecting on your

big, wet dog eyes, you scumbag.

Honestly, Stewie, I'm getting
pretty bored of hide-and-seek.

Oh, please, Brian,
just one game. Please?

(SIGHS) Okay.

But no more hiding in the fridge,

in the washing machine, the open safe

with the long-forgotten combination.

Oh, no, I'm way better now.

I might be the best player in the world.

Okay, I'm gonna go hide. Count to .

I'll probably count to, like,
six or seven minutes.

Oh, baby, that's the spot.

Hi, Glenn. What's going on?

Well, I just flew to Paris,

He must have snuck in there.

Oh, my God! Is he okay?

Yeah, he's eating one of those
weird French street ham things

that aren't good but are also amazing.

Look, how soon can you come get him?

I only have hours in Paris

and a whole list of
horny activities to do.

Okay, let me just do the math.

In hours we'd need to
get to an airport,

which we're hours from,
find a last-minute flight...

If there are any...

Fly ten hours, then wait for Peter's

post-flight airport poop...

Peter don't poop on planes.

Or we leave him in the care

and enjoy the first trip

we've had together in years.
