Anybody know how to empty
the reservoir on a realdoll?

'Cause the website is
mostly testimonials.

Peter, of course you know what today is.

Yeah, Donald Sutherland's birthday.

And maybe another special day?

National Dachshund Day.

Oh, Peter, you forgot our
anniversary again, didn't you?

What? No, no, I-I got
you an awesome gift.

But you can't see it until tonight.

Tonight? Wh-why tonight?

Oh, you'll see. Tonight
is gonna be amazing.

You're gonna smile bigger than I did

when I was on the cover
of Mad Magazine.

[LAUGHS]

You kids don't remember
mad or magazines.

Fortunately, I'm on
broadcast television.

What, me worry?

Okay, me worry.

I wonder how old Donald
Sutherland is today.

- I don't know, pretty old.
- He looks good, though.

And you know what? I think the key there

is never looking good.

Brian, quick, check
out your six o'clock.

Or-or your nine o'clock.
I can't tell time.

A perfectly good mini fridge.

Well, you're gonna have to
fight Danny Devito for it.

Would you look at that.

A perfectly good, normal-size fridge.

You know what? If this works,
I'm going to put it in my room.

Stewie, you're too little to
have a fridge in your room.

Think whatever you want,
Brian, but I'm taking this

before Danny Devito gets it.

That's all right, kid.
I don't need it anymore.

[SINGERS] ♪ Danny Devito ♪

♪ Got bit by a magic mosquito. ♪

[ANNOUNCER] Danny Devito
and the Magic Mosquito,

now streaming on peacock.

I'm hearing a lot of buzz.

There he is. Here comes the groom!

- [NOISEMAKERS BLARE]
- [APPLAUSE]

Geez, even you guys
know it's my anniversary?

- How is that possible?
- It's easy.

- I follow your wife.
- You mean on Instagram?

- Yep.
- Peter, let me guess.

You forgot your anniversary again.

Yeah. What's worse, I
lied, and I told Lois

I had a awesome gift
planned for tonight.

If I don't come up
with something amazing,

I am so screwed.

Hey, you want to give Lois a treat?

Popcorn-ucopia.

Now, they're a little outfit out there

in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
family owned and operated

for five generations over there
in the "Crossroads of America."

Indiana's state motto.

And get this. They
make a metal cannister

with three different kinds of popcorn,

but they're separated!

Maybe you should just take Lois out

to a fine restaurant.

Now, I can hear some of you
saying, "Joe, why separated?"

- None of us are saying that, Joe.
- Okay, here's why.

Three flavors of popcorn in
one tin, and they don't mix.

Unless, of course, you want them to mix.

This is a home run, man.

Kind of short notice to get a
good table in any restaurant.

I don't think you appreciate
that they don't mix.

Your caramel corn stays
separate from your cheese corn,

which stays separate
from your corn corn.

You see, in the past, you would need

- three tubs of corn.
- Yes, we get it!

We know about the corn, Joe!

[CHUCKLES] Honestly,
I don't think you do.

Forgive me for eavesdropping,

but I have a flat-bottom
dory with a quiet outboard

I'd be glad to lend you.

Full moon tonight.
Why not take your bride

on a romantic cruise
around Quahog Harbor?

You know what? I think
Lois would like that.

Ooh, the romantic boat ride
is the perfect surprise.

You can bring along a tub of popcorn,
'cause the tin's waterproof.

And if you'd like, I could also

row up alongside you and play
"Brandy" on the accordion.

Yeah, no, just the boat, thanks.

Aw, I always drive past my exit.

Lois is gonna love this, Peter.

She's gonna think
you're a true romantic,

like Michael Douglas.

So who wants to hear how
I think I got mouth cancer?

She's, uh...

She's heard this one before.

Check it out, Rupert.

Juice box, boom!

Go-gurts? Yep.

And most importantly, for freshness,

an open box of Armie
Hammer's baking powder,

now with % more fingers.

Pretty much all he had
to do was not eat people.

How the hell did you get that up here?

With no help from you, thanks.

But you know what? You still get a cola.

Ah. Convenient, I guess.

Can's not so cold, though.

Yeah, everything in there is
either lukewarm or frozen solid.

Stewie, I still think it's a bad idea

for you to have this thing in here.

Yeah, not really looking
for advice from the guy

who puts a fire emoji on all
Dua Lipa's Instagram posts.

She's not gonna respond, Bri.

She used to respond before
she had so many fans.

She was ! And she thought you were

- because you said you were .
- Because I was !

See? You're still saying it.

Well, happy anniversary, Lois.

Huh? Did I tell you? Isn't this nice?

You know, I have to
admit I had my doubts,

but you really surprised me.

A romantic dinner on a boat?

Right? Who needs a fancy restaurant

when you can be wet and kind of dizzy?

Oh, Peter, it's just perfect.

Well, except for that cruise ship

that still can't dock because of Covid.

Is the election over yet?

We are all pooping in the sink!

I'm from Iowa, so I still
think this is awesome.

Oh, there's something about the ocean

that's always been so magical to me.

And I say we celebrate.

Ah, now we're talking.

All right, cannonball!

Shark! [PANICKED SHOUTS]

[LOIS CRIES OUT]

Peter! Peter, don't
leave me to die out here!

Peter, come back!

Hold on, Lois. I'm gonna grab
a real quick hot chocolate.

Warm up my bones.

[PHONE DINGS]

Hey, good morning, lovebirds.

So, how'd the moonlight cruise go?

Dad saw a shark and left mom to die.

Oh, come on. All that nice stuff

I did last night, we're only
gonna focus on that one thing?

Damn it, Peter, you're supposed
to be the alpha in my life.

Someone to stand up and take charge.

But you never even looked
back to see if I was okay.

Y-you just raced off.

You hear about Anne Heche? Sad, huh?

Peter, don't try to change the subject!

You were always jealous of her!

You know what, Peter?

I am so disappointed in you,

I am taking the exclamation
points out of this argument.

You can't do that.

Male arguments are
powerless without volume.

That just leaves us with words.

[CALMLY] I'm done here.

Wow, Peter, I've never
seen Lois so upset.

Looks like you're in...

and I find this phrase offensive...

the doghouse.

Oh, I've solved bigger
problems than this.

Like when I forgot the
safe word at that sex party.

Aardvark. Aah!

Aardwolf. Abacus. Aah!

Abandon. Aah! Abase. Aah!

Abate. Aah! Abattoir.

[PETER] The good news
was I had memorized

the entire dictionary when
I got bored over Covid.

The bad news was the
safe word was "zyzzyva,"

a genus of south American weevils,

which, coincidentally,
I was forced to keister.

[REGGAE MUSIC PLAYING]

[PHONE CLICKING]

Bri, what up, dawg? Grab
a Brewski from the mini.

I can't have any more, though.

Got to cram for a test in the morning.

Where exactly are you going to school?

Um, university of college.

Not for long, though.

Just got my grades. Not good.

Stewie, I think this fridge thing...

Yo check out my maxim posters.

Hot, right? No, no. Yes, yes.

No, yes, no.

- Why would you put up the nos?
- So you know when it's a yes.

Stewie, we got to talk.

Brah, if this is about
you and I being roommates,

I was gonna put a word in with Colin,

but I already have one.

Brian, meet Guy.

Guy? Okay. Pleased to meet you.

Oh, Guy doesn't speak much English.

He's from Quebec. Engineering, I think.

But he is insane, Brian. A legend.

Guy. Allons.

Ah, look at him drinking that soda.

Classic Guy.

- Okay, anyway, Stewie...
- Can't talk now, Bri.

Got to spend some time
messing around on the guitar.

[DISCORDANT NOTES]

I didn't even know you played.

Oh, yeah, all the time. A lot.

Bros down the hall call me "Ramen,"

'cause I'm always noodling.

Hey, what's going on, no pubes?

They-they... They call,
they call me a lot of things.

Lois, I told you I
would make it up to you,

so I got you something very special.

I got you in the opening
credits of SNL.

- [LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING]
- [PETER] Okay, look.

Here comes Kenan.
Oh, look at him playfully hailing a cab.

And here you are.

Look how cool and hip you look

walking by a manhole cover
with steam coming out of it.


Uhp, looks like Kenan's still
trying to wave down a cab.

Ah, there you go again!
Now you're at the club,

holding up a "one more"
signal for a drink.

Why won't nobody stop for Kenan?

Oh, but Mikey Day gets a cab first try.

Oh, he's sharing it with Kenan.

He's sharing it. Okay.

Oh, a very stressful
opening credits this week.

Stewie, did you do this?

Geez, Brian, don't just come
barging in here like that.

I thought you were campus security.

Guy pushed an air conditioner

off the parking garage yesterday.

Almost hit a public safety officer.

By the way, that's between us.

They're going door to
door. It's pretty serious.

I don't care about that.

I want to know who
wrote "renob" on my chest

when I was sleeping.

"Renob"? Brian, you
read that in the mirror.

- It's "boner."
- What?!

Great. Thanks, Bri.

Now we've got the R.A.
coming in to check on us.

Hey, Stewie, Guy, look,

I like fun as much as anybody,
but we've had some complaints,

and you really got to keep
the noise down in here.

Oh, and, hey, I reviewed
your party application,

and everything looks to be in order,

so you're good to go.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Party?

- Who's having a party?
- I am.

And it'll be loaded with
chicks, thanks to Guy.

This guy's all about the poutine,

which sounds dirty,
but it's just a gravy

they put on french fries.

Stewie, you've taken this
mini fridge thing too far.

I'm moving this thing out of here.

Oh, be careful, Bri. Not a good idea.

You don't want to piss off Guy.

Yesterday he crow-hopped a
dip tin and knocked a guy out.

Oh, wow, did he really?

Well, now I'm so very scared of guy.

- Aah!
- Oh, ho, ho, Guy.

Ce fut un grand lancer!

Je crois qu'il est mort, eh?

Special flowers for a special lady.

Hmm. These are nice. Except... [SNIFFS]

They smell like...
what is that, exhaust?

Why is there a picture of
a teenage Latina on them?

Peter, did you steal these
from a roadside memorial?

They didn't love her as
much as I love you, Lois.

Besides, it's not like she can see 'em.

Stolen flowers? Really, Peter?

Is that all I mean to you?

Well, there's also a
candle with one of them

spooky skeletons from coco.

You know, Peter, a relationship is

supposed to grow over time,

to give you a sense
of purpose and meaning.

But after all these years with you,

I-I just feel worthless.

I feel as worthless as any
coin smaller than a quarter.

Hello, my name is Nickel.

[ALL] Hi, Nickel.

There was a time when I paid for

a ride on a trolley, or a good cigar,

or a hand-cranked film
of a man tipping his hat

and twirling his moustache.

But yesterday, I was part
of a handful of change

at a McDonald's,

and the teenage girl threw us out.

Just-just threw us in the trash
with the wrappers and the bag.

[SOBS]

Yeah. And I'm voiced by Kevin Hart.

[ANNOUNCER] Coming this
fall from Pixar, Coins!

We'll keep making things
talk until you don't show up.

Come on, Lois. Are you
gonna stay mad at me forever?

I've done stupid things before,
and you've always forgiven me.

Oh, I forgive you, Peter.

I just don't think I'll
ever be able to see you

as a man, my protector
or a real husband again.

Oh, okay.

I see.

Well, if that's how you
feel, I'll just take my things

and get out of your way.

This is a different realdoll.

I never figured out how
to empty the other one.

This is not good, guys.

She put a little black-and-white TV

on the sun porch and then
slept there last night.

Ooh, that's the angriest
a new England wife can get.

Look, if I could do it all
over again, I'd save her,

'cause now I know it was a dolphin

and there was no real danger.

Peter, don't you see?

We got to make you the hero again.

Wait, say that again.

We got to make you the hero again.

Yep, yeah, you got weird teeth.

Wait. What did you say
before about the hero thing?

I said we've got to
make Peter the hero...

You're right. He does have weird teeth.

I just have to show Lois
I can still be her hero.

[MUFFLED] That's exactly
what I was saying.

[LOUD DANCE MUSIC PLAYING]

Brian, you made it.

Aw, damn it, I love this son of a bitch.

Are you... Are you drunk?

Nah, I just spun around a few times.

Stewie, it's-it's really loud.

Oh, that's all Guy, man.

His speakers aren't
even legal in America.

Stewie, you were supposed
to be in bed at : .

The only clock we have in
here says "miller time."

Come on, Brian, this could be
the greatest night of our lives,

but you're all, "Stewie's too
little to have a mini fridge."

What happened to the
Brian I used to know?

[DANCE MUSIC CONTINUES LOUDER]

You know what? You're right.

I guess I was just
worried about your safety.

But what the hell.

I can party with the
best of them, even Guy.

There you go.

What's the worst that could
happen, right? Check it.

Guy put his speakers out the window,

and he's cranking Wagner.

Everybody's like, "what?!"
