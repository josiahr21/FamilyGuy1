(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

Welcome to our home,

and thank you all so much
for coming to celebrate

our dear Lois and her wonderful husband,

uh, Peter.

I know Carter wanted to say a few words.

Poor, unfunny, fat.

Oh, and the sprinklers come on at : .

I don't know how to change that,
so we have until then.

Beautifully said.

Wow.

Lot of years for us.

Uh-huh.

Hey, so what do you think about dinner?

Oh, God, I'm so tired
of thinking about dinner.

I-I don't know.

Well, what are you in the mood for?

Okay, that's just another version
of the same question.

Oh, I've collected nine finalists

for our new end table. We should talk.

Will each one be instantly
overcrowded by three items?

- Absolutely.
- Great.

So where did we land, dinner-wise?

If I could have everyone's attention,

it's time to present Peter and Lois

with a very special anniversary gift.

Yes, we really went all out this year.

Okay, "we" is
an insane characterization,

but here it is.

A brand-new Range Rider!

That's it? Aw, crap.

It looked so much bigger
in the SkyMall magazine.

QUAGMIRE: That's a rookie move, man!

Lois, I'm sorry. I-I didn't
realize it was a toy car

for a child. I can...

It's fine, Daddy. Really.

I-I bet Stewie
might enjoy playing with it.

Will there be, like...

a replacement gift or no?

That's very sweet, Lois.
Always thinking of others.

Amazon gift card?

It's the thought that counts, Daddy.

And it was a very nice thought.

$ bill cupped in a handshake?

I'm gonna go change
out of this wet suit.

Mwah.

Wow! A white Range Rider SUV!

Hey, what was Ari's wife's name
on Entourage?

Eh, can't remember. Doesn't matter.

I'm Ari's wife.

Good work today, Mom Bathing Suit.

See you on Labor Day.

Nah, I'll wash it off.

It's my fault
for over-guac'ing the chip.

Aah!

Aah! Joe! I'm in here!

Sorry, I didn't realize!

So, Lois, you would not believe

the night Joe and I had last night.

Oh. Really?

Yeah. It was easily some of the
best sex of our entire marriage.

And for the first time in nine years,

Joe was able to achieve manhood.

You know, without a pill,
a sh*t or a pump.

Oh, you-you don't say.

It was crazy. I can't even count
all the different positions

Joe let me carefully arrange
his limp body into.

Oh, wow, I'm so happy

you two were able
to rekindle that spark.

(PHONE CHIMES)

Whoops, got to go.

I've got lunch with the girls.

W... (CHUCKLES) I thought
I was one of the girls.

You're one of the gals.

(DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)

Oh, no. What am I gonna do?

I bet Joe was only able to do it
'cause he was thinkin' of me.

Chris?

I've been caught,
but I'll never be sorry.

Boy, I went hard at my fat guys'
wrestling club today.

(SLOSHING)

I understood that with
great reward comes great risk.

Hey, Bri, check out my new "hwhip."

Pretty cool, huh?

You might even say it's a cool hwhi...

I will say though, seems like
you're really embracing

the Range Rider lifestyle.

Oh, this thing's the best.

J.D. Power and Associates

WITHERSPOON: I am an American citizen.

Turn left at the light.

The only thing is, eight different

I think they just assumed I'm Persian.

Seems right.

There's a whole section

Would you like to add a dollar

No. I gave a disabled guy an erection.

Stop throwing 'em out

it's all right.

Let's not talk about that, hmm?

There's something very important
I need to talk to you about.

adopted?

What? No. What?

Are you getting divorced?

I'm not even married.

We're moving again, 'cause of the Army?

Well, it's a big move up for me

and you're gonna get
your own room and...

I mean, no! No!
That-That's not... Look, look.

What I'm trying to tell you

is I saw Lois strutting around
your front yard,

basically putting on a sex show for Joe.

And he was into it.

What? He-he was?

Are you sure?

Trust me, Peter, when it comes to sex,

I know what I'm talking about.

L-Like, did you know %

when they're having sex
with their spouse?

Wow, did you read that in an article?

No, I do all my own research.

thinking of right now?

Um, Chris Pine.

Damn it. I'll teach Joe to ogle my wife.

Not a good day for Joe.

Not... a good day... for Joe.

Peter, this is insane.

I can't believe you would
b*at up your own friend.

Well, can you blame me?

After the sick show
you two were putting on out there?

Fine, Peter.
So what if I was putting on a show?

At least someone was in the audience.

And maybe ask yourself why
I'd even feel I have to do that.

I come out of the bathroom
in my underwear last night

and all you want to do
is look at James Cromwell.

It was weird. He had most of his hair.

You don't find me attractive anymore.

Oh, come on, it's not you... it's time.

After all these years of marriage,

your naked body has pretty much
no effect on me anymore.

It's basically like staring
at a chair from the DMV.

Well, sue me for trying
to help reignite the passion

in another couple's marriage.

I can't seem to do it in my own.

That's not what you're doing.
You're flaunting yourself

in front of the whole neighborhood
just to boost your own ego.

(SIGHS) All right, Peter,
I'll be honest with you.

We're moving again, 'cause of the Army?

What? No. We're talking about Joe.

Oh, right. We're moving again
'cause Joe's in the Army.

what was the cause of the accident?

Yeah, I don't know how that thing broke.

Well, I see your neighbor
has a Nest camera.

That was from a previous attempt.

I thought I looked hot,
but then the paperboy laughed.

I was wondering if you needed
to borrow a cup of sugar.

No, thanks, Lois.

And, also, that's not how
the sugar thing usually works.

Well, I just...

Lois, you can stop
with the phony excuses.

I know why you've been doing
what you're doing,

and I think it's better if you stop.

But, Joe, I just...

Look, I've given this
tremendous thought,

wondering if the reason
I became so excited

by all that's happened
is that Peter's a good friend

and perhaps the affection you two share

was briefly channeled towards me

as a reminder and renewal
of the importance

of maintaining a deep sense of
wonder and curiosity about life.

But then I realized it was
mostly about seeing side-boob

that was not my wife's side-boob.

It just has to be different.

I can't stress that enough.

But-but I'm okay with that, Joe.

Sorry, Lois. I can't do this to Peter.

But please know that you
have done a great service

for my and Bonnie's sex life.

Oh, I understand.

Bye, Joe.

You're not going on a catheter
run, by any chance, are you?

Do you need me to get you catheters?
