Ah, it's so exciting to be back
at the Halloween Carnival.

Yep. Thanks to the vaccines,

we can all get back to doing
the things we hate.

Oh, for God's sakes, Peter,

I am so tired of you
not making an effort

to be a part of this family.

Lois, I drove us here.
I bought the tickets.

I'm sadly shuffling
through this place with you.

- What more do you want?
- Well, I don't know.

I want you to act
like you're happy

to be with your family
every now and again.

Look, I'm doing the best I can,
but I got to tell you...

Whoa!

Careful.

Oh, and there's my boss.
Even better.

Hey, Preston.
What's with the hat?

This is my Halloween costume.

I'm dressed
as s comedian Paul Shore.

You-you mean Pauly Shore?

Perhaps in less
formal circumstances.

You may recall he borrowed
heavily from surf culture,

with phrases such as,
"Hey, buddy," and "Grindage".

I don't think
this costume is working.

Neither is Pauly Shore.

Ooh! That looks scary.

I'd like to tell you about
UNTUCKit shirts.

I-I'm hitting "skip ahead,"

PODCASTER: Last weekend,
I was at a barbecue and thought,

"What's with
all this excess fabric

at the bottom of my shirt?"

Oh, God! A clearly fake
personal story!

PODCASTER: The big game was
on the boob tube,

but the biggest touchdown
was the perfect length

of my friend's premium-made,
affordably priced shirt.

Literally no one talks
like that!

PODCASTER: So, I went right home

on my Microsoft Surface.

Is this a promotion

PODCASTER:
UNTUCKit shirts.

We weren't here for Kevin James,

All right, g*ng, as a mom

I'm gonna put

Chris, honey, are you...
Are you having a good time?

(nervous laugh) Okay, I'm gonna
need a verbal response.

- Yeah.
- Oh, good.

Chris is having a good time.

Meg. Meg, are you having
a good time

- just like your brother?
- I guess.

Okay, great.

Can you sign this form

Wow, very good.

It's my only one.

Maybe there are...

Yeah!

Oh, Peter, there you are.

Listen, I'm trying

Perfect. I love working

Oh, Peter, thanks

Yeah, they say the best day

And the next best day is today!

This, this is what I meant

about making an effort

And I can garden, too,
'cause I have a brown thumb.

That's more of a wiping issue,
son, but I'm glad you're here.

This is great,
but I'm a little hot.

No problem, that's why
I bought a giant sun hat

And now to quote

"Lettuce turnip the beet."

Stop it or I'm gonna wet myself.

Me, too. I always wet my plants.

Where do you get all this?

They're all from towels, Lois!

They're all from towels!

Well, what do you think, guys?

Should we wrap it up?

Yeah, but can one of you

She hates you guys.

Peter, I think you're

No, no, it's okay.

Ah, Peter, that's a great idea!

(scoffs) Good luck, pal.

Our Christmas letter
always runs aground

'cause our family has
no accomplishments.

All right, we need
some highlights from our year.

Um, I got suspended
for setting up a tent

in my Spanish teacher's
front yard.

"After several
adventurous camping trips,

"Chris is becoming
quite the outdoors man

I was trying to snag a bagel
from the school dumpster

and got accidentally hoisted
into the garbage truck.

"This was the year
Meg caught the travel bug."

Stewie's first pony ride ended

after he blew out his diaper
all over the horse's back.

"Stewie pooped on a horse."

Whoa, Pop,
