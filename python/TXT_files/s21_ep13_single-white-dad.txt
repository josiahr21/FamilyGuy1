Chris, your mother and I<br>
divided all our stuff   <br>
 <br>
after a recent argument,   <br>
 <br>
and I came across<br>
something very special:   <br>
 <br>
the Nintendo NES.   <br>

This is a day I've been<br>
waiting for for    years,   <br>

and now, I get to share it with my son.   <br>

- What are you talking about?   <br>
 <br>
Uh, what universe does this<br>
even take place in?   <br>
 <br>
Everything needs to take place<br>
in a universe.   <br>
 <br>
It's a warehouse with ladders<br>
where a monkey took a girl.   <br>
 <br>
What about the micro-transactions   <br>
 <br>
that slowly bankrupt our family?   <br>
 <br>
Or the children slinging r*cist<br>
taunts into your earpiece?   <br>
 <br>
It has two buttons, and I have<br>
to look down when I press them.   <br>
 <br>
Donkey Kong sucks.   <br>
 <br>
I could build the same game<br>
on our house.   <br>

- Donkey Kong house?   <br>

Sorry I put you in a dress, Stewie.   <br>

- We needed a damsel.<br>
- Hey, do I look upset?   <br>
 <br>
What do we got today?   <br>
 <br>
Looks like a Donkey Kong house.   <br>

(SIGHS) What a mess.   <br>
 <br>
- Want a beer?<br>
- Yes, sir.   <br>

- Is that a YETI?<br>

(SIGHS) The doctor said<br>
I'm gonna be laid up for a week,   <br>
 <br>
so you'll have to take care of the kids,   <br>
 <br>
but that'll give you some quality time   <br>
 <br>
with them, huh? Are you excited?   <br>
 <br>
No, and you know that.   <br>
 <br>
Are you brushing with a grill brush?   <br>
 <br>
I left my toothbrush<br>
at a hotel three years ago.   <br>
 <br>
Look, now, don't worry,<br>
it's just a week,   <br>
 <br>
and taking care of kids<br>
is not that hard.   <br>

The Facebook status of every girl   <br>

would disagree.   <br>

Plus, you know I'm not very good<br>
at taking care of things.   <br>

Remember, I even lost custody<br>
of our orchid.   <br>

Please, you can't take my baby.   <br>

- Every day.   <br>

Not that much. What about sun?   <br>

We'll hang out on the patio.   <br>

How about the food and the drinks?   <br>

Wow, everybody's being so nice.    <br>

but it looks like you've got<br>
your hands full today.    <br>

 <br>
Can you stuff<br>
a blueberry muffin into a cup    <br>
 <br>
and pour coffee all over it?    <br>
 <br>
Normally, no, but I can't say<br>
"no" to a super dad like you.    <br>

Where's this little guy's mom?<br>
Is she coming in, too?    <br>
 <br>
No, she's not with us.    <br>

There he is.    <br>

How's the week going as the solo dad?    <br>
 <br>
And how is Lois' foot?    <br>
 <br>
I'm not rooting for her<br>
to lose it, but...    <br>
 <br>
Are you guys about to talk<br>
about your kids?    <br>
 <br>
You said I can look at my phone<br>
when you talk about your kids.    <br>
 <br>
This is the closest<br>
I've ever been to Mr. Quagmire.    <br>
 <br>
He's wearing makeup.    <br>
 <br>
You know, I thought this week<br>
was gonna suck,    <br>
 <br>
but everywhere I go people<br>
are super helpful and nice.    <br>
 <br>
That's because you're a dad alone.    <br>
 <br>
That's the closest thing<br>
people get to seeing a hero.    <br>
 <br>
It's right after wounded veteran    <br>
 <br>
or ugly person who sings well.    <br>
 <br>
Totally. A mom alone<br>
with her kids is a mess,    <br>
 <br>
but when a woman sees a dad<br>
doing the same thing,    <br>
 <br>
total panty dropper.    <br>
 <br>
Ew, Joe.    <br>
 <br>
I've also been lying<br>
about Lois being dead    <br>
 <br>
to get free things.    <br>
 <br>
- Thoughts?<br>
- What kind of free things?    <br>
 <br>
Pie, mostly.    <br>
 <br>
- Good pie?<br>
- Homemade.    <br>
 <br>
That's better than regular-made.    <br>
 <br>
Bonnie lies about me being dead<br>
all the time. You're fine.    <br>
 <br>
Just as long as you share<br>
that pie with Kirby here.    <br>
 <br>
- Right, little guy?<br>
- Who's Kirby?    <br>
 <br>
- Your son. Kirby.<br>
- His name is Stewie.    <br>
 <br>
Huh. Looks like a Kirby.    <br>
 <br>
No one looks like a Kirby.    <br>
 <br>
You'll see. I've never been<br>
wrong about a Kirby.    <br>

(BELL RINGS)    <br>
 <br>
Peter? Can you come up here?    <br>
 <br>
Need something, Lois?    <br>
 <br>
Oh, well, I just need<br>
the Apple TV remote.    <br>
 <br>
Well, I am great at fetch. (LAUGHS)    <br>
 <br>
Just the remote, please.    <br>

 <br>
Oh, maybe.    <br>

when you handed me that remote.    <br>

Why don't you start down by my cast?    <br>
 <br>
Oh, God, your leg is covered in hair.    <br>

That's right. I can't shave down there    <br>

'cause the cast will get wet.    <br>

I know how hard it can be<br>
being a single parent.    <br>

I can make some lunch,<br>

maybe pull out the<br>

for ourselves.    <br>

I guess lying about having<br>
a dead wife to eat popcorn    <br>

wasn't the best idea.    <br>

That's a nice story, Peter.    <br>

Well, there's two things<br>
you can do from here:    <br>

break it off or go full scumbag.    <br>

If you're interested in going<br>
scumbag, I sell a starter kit.    <br>

- Nobody does.    <br>

 <br>
She clearly saw it as something else.    <br>

I got to break it off<br>
before Lois finds out.    <br>

You need to break it off 'cause    <br>

it's the right thing to do.    <br>

- That place you hate.    <br>
 <br>
- Oh.<br>
- Yeah.    <br>
 <br>
Well, maybe I'll just come<br>
downstairs and join you anyway.    <br>
 <br>
You know, it's been about a week,<br>
and I'm starting to feel better.    <br>
 <br>
Uh, no, no, no. Trust me,<br>
you-you-you don't want to go downstairs.    <br>
 <br>
Uh, Brian is talking<br>
about the Electoral College.    <br>
 <br>
- Oh.<br>
- Yeah.    <br>
 <br>
- I'll just eat dinner up here.<br>
- (DOORBELL RINGS)    <br>
 <br>
<em class="text-italics">Excusez moi.</em>    <br>
 <br>
(YELPS, CHUCKLES)    <br>
 <br>
Hi, I have your boner<br>
and butt pills from Gladiator.    <br>
 <br>
That's supposed to be discreet.    <br>
 <br>
Hey, Dad. Where's Mom?    <br>
 <br>
Upstairs... Uh, the big upstairs.    <br>
 <br>
- That's what we call heaven.<br>
- Mm. I get it.    <br>
 <br>
I tell T. J. that<br>
my late husband Scott's...    <br>
 <br>
- (YAWNS) Huh?<br>
- (BELL RINGS)    <br>
 <br>
Mom's calling.    <br>
 <br>
I-I told them every time a bell rings,    <br>
 <br>
that's their mom saying hello.    <br>
 <br>
- LOIS: Help.<br>
- Help, help. Saying-saying help.    <br>
 <br>
She-she d*ed very painfully.<br>
<em class="text-italics">Pardonnez moi.</em>    <br>
 <br>
You forgot your box<br>
of boner and butt pills.    <br>
 <br>
It's discreet.    <br>
 <br>
(GRUNTS)    <br>
 <br>
(SINGSONGY): Mur-der the carpet.    <br>
 <br>
Hello.    <br>
 <br>
I... What are you doing?    <br>
 <br>
Can you help me down the stairs?    <br>
 <br>
Uh, th-the doctor said<br>
to stay in bed a week.    <br>
 <br>
You know, I just need<br>
to get out of this room.    <br>
 <br>
My back is k*lling me.    <br>
 <br>
(INHALES SHARPLY) Lois,    <br>
 <br>
if you stay up here<br>
for the rest of the night,    <br>
 <br>
I will use the marital tongue on you.    <br>
 <br>
Okay, but this time,<br>
I get to pick the spot.    <br>
 <br>
In the meantime, can you just<br>
get me the heating pad    <br>
 <br>
for my back? It's in the attic.    <br>
 <br>
- (TIMER DINGS)<br>
- The roast.    <br>
 <br>
Wait a minute, I'm not cooking dinner.    <br>
 <br>
Heating pad, heating pad, heating pad...    <br>
 <br>
- (DOOR CLOSES)<br>
- Oh, crap.    <br>
 <br>
Hey. H-Hey, what are you doing, Bonnie?    <br>
 <br>
I told Lois I would bring her<br>
a loaf of my sourdough bread.    <br>
 <br>
- She doesn't want it.<br>
- What?    <br>
 <br>
I just talked to her.    <br>
 <br>
She's dead. Lois d*ed. Go away.    <br>
 <br>
Oh, my God.    <br>
 <br>
What are you doing<br>
with her washing machine?    <br>
 <br>
It's not for sale.<br>
You'd need a furniture dolly    <br>
 <br>
to get it out of the basement anyway.    <br>
 <br>
We have one. I'll give you $   .    <br>
 <br>
Yeah, y... O-O-Okay. Maybe. Maybe.    <br>
 <br>
Will it fit through the bulkhead door?    <br>
 <br>
Yeah, it looks like it'll fit.    <br>
 <br>
It'll totally fit.    <br>
 <br>
Yeah, all right. Let's do it. $   .    <br>
 <br>
Heating pad.    <br>
 <br>
(LAUGHS) Ah, wonderful.    <br>
 <br>
(YELPS)    <br>
 <br>
Ugh, terrific.    <br>
 <br>
(STOMPING ON ROOF)    <br>
 <br>
(SCOFFS) Probably a prowler.<br>
It's cool, I know him.    <br>
 <br>
He'll just go right into my bed.    <br>
 <br>
- Hey.<br>
- Hey, Meg's eating dinner.    <br>
 <br>
That's cool, I'll wait.    <br>
 <br>
(LAUGHING): It's kind of my thing.    <br>
 <br>
How am I gonna get down?    <br>
 <br>
If you hold this feather, you can fly.    <br>
 <br>
Really? Wow, thanks, little rat.    <br>
 <br>
Ow! (GRUNTS)    <br>
 <br>
That's for putting locks<br>
on your garbage cans, you d*ck.    <br>
 <br>
(GASPS)    <br>
 <br>
Heating pad.    <br>
 <br>
Where did you go? And why was your box    <br>
 <br>
of boner and butt pills on the stairs?    <br>
 <br>
I almost tripped.    <br>
 <br>
Those are discreet.    <br>
 <br>
Now, let's get you back upstairs.    <br>
 <br>
(GASPS, GRUNTS)    <br>
 <br>
(GROANS) It's all right, Peter,    <br>
 <br>
- just open the Calm app.<br>
- (PHONE BEEPS)    <br>
 <br>
"Your credit card<br>
has been decli..." Whee!    <br>
 <br>
There you are, Peter. Are you okay?    <br>
 <br>
Is this your mother?    <br>
 <br>
I'm sorry. Who the hell are you,<br>
and why are you holding my baby?    <br>
 <br>
See? Total bitch, right?    <br>
 <br>
Boy, this-this is gonna be<br>
a really funny story    <br>
 <br>
when I tell you both separately<br>
far away from each other.    <br>
 <br>
- Hey, Mom.<br>
- Mom?    <br>
 <br>
Peter said you were dead.    <br>
 <br>
Dead? I am not dead.    <br>
 <br>
I was just recovering from foot surgery,    <br>
 <br>
so I put him in charge of the kids.    <br>
 <br>
- Now, what the hell happened?<br>
- Heating pad?    <br>
 <br>
I cannot believe this, Peter.    <br>
 <br>
You've been lying to me?    <br>
 <br>
I thought we had something.    <br>
 <br>
And what kind of a mother<br>
leaves their husband    <br>
 <br>
with the kids for a week?<br>
It is a miracle they're alive.    <br>
 <br>
- Excuse me?<br>
- I'll tell you what kind of mother,    <br>
 <br>
the best mom there is.    <br>
 <br>
I'm sorry I lied to you, Becky.    <br>
 <br>
All I wanted was free popcorn.    <br>
 <br>
Taking care of kids is relentless.    <br>
 <br>
There's no escape.    <br>
 <br>
You know, unless you<br>
"accidentally" leave them    <br>
 <br>
in a hot car.    <br>
 <br>
I mean, you'd get less jail time<br>
than actual m*rder, right?    <br>
 <br>
And-and prison has to be<br>
quieter than your actual life.    <br>
 <br>
Anyway, if I've learned<br>
anything this week,    <br>
 <br>
it's that all mothers are heroes,    <br>
 <br>
and the biggest hero I know    <br>
 <br>
is the one I'm lucky enough<br>
to call my wife.    <br>
 <br>
Oh, Peter,    <br>
 <br>
that almost cancels out<br>
everything you've done.    <br>
 <br>
Look, Becky, I don't blame you<br>
for what happened.    <br>
 <br>
Nobody does.    <br>
 <br>
But you're a beautiful woman,    <br>
 <br>
you can do better than a<br>
  -year-old morbidly obese guy.    <br>
 <br>
You know what, you're right.    <br>
 <br>
Ever since I lost<br>
my late husband Scott, I...    <br>
 <br>
GRIFFINS: (YAWNS) Huh?    <br>
 <br>
The other mom just left, and now,    <br>
 <br>
Bonnie's dragging a washing machine    <br>
 <br>
out from the bulkhead.    <br>
 <br>
(CHUCKLES) Never a dull moment.    <br>
 <br>
Hey, grab me a beer from the YETI.    <br>
 <br>
- You know it'll be cold, right?<br>
- Mm-hmm.    <br>
 <br>
Just picture it, the place:<br>
Dripping Springs, Texas.    <br>
 <br>
Roy and Ryan Seiders,    <br>
 <br>
brothers tired of their<br>
conventional coolers breaking    <br>
 <br>
when they would stand-cast<br>
into the Gulf Coast,    <br>
 <br>
took matters into their own hands    <br>
 <br>
and created the cooler<br>
to end all coolers.    <br>
 <br>
<em class="text-italics">ANNOUNCER: Yeti coolers:</em>    <br>

 <br>
(SIGHS) Well, I'm glad<br>
my foot's all healed.    <br>
 <br>
It's so nice to be back downstairs.    <br>
 <br>
Yeah, and I'm happy our relationship    <br>
 <br>
is stronger than ever, and<br>
everything is back to normal.    <br>
 <br>
Well, except every time<br>
I look out the window,    <br>
 <br>
the beginning of "Kiss Me"<br>
